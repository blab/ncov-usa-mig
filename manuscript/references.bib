  abstract = {Objectives: Our goal was to investigate wait times related to hepatitis C virus treatment with directacting antivirals before versus after liver transplant at a single center as well as wait times for insurance approval for preemptive treatment with these agents after liver transplant. Material and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated hepatitis C virus infections in transplant recipients of deceased liver donations in 2014 and 2015. Demographics, hepatocellular carcinoma incidence, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores, and transplant wait times were compared between patients treated before or after liver transplant. Wait times to approval of direct-acting antiviral treatment were evaluated in those untreated before transplant. Results: During our study period, of 67 deceased-donor liver transplants, 21 patients received hepatitis C virus treatment pretransplant (treated group) and 46 patients were not treated pretransplant (untreated group). Twenty-five patients in the untreated group received hepatitis C virus-positive donations, with all in this group treated with direct-acting antivirals. We found no statistically significant differences regarding age, sex, race, donation after cardiac death, or incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma between groups. The treated group had a longer median wait time (287 vs 172 days; P =.02). Twelve of the 46 untreated patients (26.1\%) developed biopsy-proven hepatitis C virus-related relapse (median 87 days; range, 55-383 days). Preemptive direct-acting antiviral therapy was initiated at a median of 81 days in the untreated group. Conclusions: Although treatment of hepatitis C virus before liver transplant is an attractive option to eliminate the risk of complications, it can limit the donor pool for recipients to uninfected donors, significantly increasing wait times in regions with large hepatitis C virus-positive donor pools. Allocation of Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score was not different between the treated and untreated groups. Insurance companies should revise their policies for rapid approval of preemptive direct-acting antiviral treatment after liver transplant.

However, the majority of such studies have not explained the pathways that link residential segregation and specific health outcomes. This paper presents a conceptual framework of the role that residential segregation may play in the epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB) and other infectious diseases. This is an important issue given the concentration of TB cases among US racial/ethnic minorities and the increasing gap in the incidence of infectious diseases between minorities and the white majority. Segregation may have an indirect effect on the transmission of TB because of its negative impact on the quality of neighborhood environment in segregated communities. Segregation concentrates poverty, overcrowded and dilapidated housing and social disintegration in minority areas, and results in limited access to health care. Furthermore, two dimensions of residential segregation (isolation and concentration) may have direct effects on TB transmission. The isolation of minorities confines TB to segregated areas and prevents transmission to the rest of the population. High-density levels in minority areas increase the probability of transmission within the segregated group. In order to operationalize the above pathways, health researchers may rely on the segregation literature, which has conceptualized various dimensions of residential segregation and proposed ways to measure them. The indirect pathways that link segregation and TB can be captured through exposure indices, which quantify the concentration of risk factors for TB for various racial and ethnic groups. The direct pathways can be captured through the isolation index (which is a proxy for the degree of interaction between the segregated group and the rest of the population) and two proposed measures of density (which are proxies for the likelihood of transmission within the segregated group and from the segregated group to the rest of the population).},

However, recent studies have suggested an unsuspected high rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective case-control study was carried out to investigate the impact of DAAs on tumor recurrence in patients with complete response to HCC treatment within our HCV-related cirrhosis cohort. Patients who received [group 1 (G1), n=22] or not [group 2 (G2), n=49] a DAAs therapy were matched 1\,:\,2 for age, sex, liver function, HCC stage, and treatment. RESULTS Initial HCC were mostly Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A (95\% G1, 94\% G2). Sustained viral response with DAAs was achieved in 86\% of patients. After a similar median overall follow-up time with similar radiologic surveillance after HCC treatment, 41\% of patients developed radiologic tumor recurrence in G1 versus 35\% of patients in G2 (P=0.7904). There was no significant difference in time to progression between the two groups [12 (9-16) months G1 vs. 14 (8-21) months G2, P=0.7688], or Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage at recurrence. However, the interval between HCC treatment and antiviral therapy was significantly different among DAAs patients with recurrence and those without recurrence [7.0 (2.5-9.0) months vs. 36.0 (9.0-58.0) months, P=0.0235, respectively]. CONCLUSION In our case-control study, HCV therapy with DAAs does not accelerate or prevent early HCC recurrence compared with untreated patients. The rate of recurrence, time to progression, and HCC pattern are similar. Early DAAs treatment ({$<$}12 months) after HCC cure should be discouraged considering the HCC recurrence rate during this period.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Disease maps can serve to display incidence rates geographically, to inform on public health provision about the success or failure of interventions, and to make hypothesis or to provide evidences concerning disease etiology. Poisson kriging was recently introduced to filter the noise attached to rates recorded over sparsely populated administrative units. Its benefit over simple population-weighted averages and empirical Bayesian smoothers was demonstrated by simulation studies using county-level cancer mortality rates. This paper presents the first application of Poisson kriging to the spatial interpolation of local disease rates, resulting in continuous maps of disease rate estimates and the associated prediction variance. The methodology is illustrated using cholera and dysentery data collected in a cholera endemic area (Matlab) of Bangladesh. RESULTS: The spatial analysis was confined to patrilineally-related clusters of households, known as baris, located within 9 kilometers from the Matlab hospital to avoid underestimating the risk of disease incidence, since patients far away from the medical facilities are less likely to travel. Semivariogram models reveal a range of autocorrelation of 1.1 km for dysentery and 0.37 km for cholera. This result translates into a cholera risk map that is patchier than the dysentery map that shows a large zone of high incidence in the south-central part of the study area, which is quasi-urban. On both maps, lower risk values are found in the Northern part of the study area, which is also the most distant from the Matlab hospital. The weaker spatial continuity of cholera versus dysentery incidence rates resulted in larger kriging variance across the study area. CONCLUSION: The approach presented in this paper enables researchers to incorporate the pattern of spatial dependence of incidence rates into the mapping of risk values and the quantification of the associated uncertainty. Differences in spatial patterns, in particular the range of spatial autocorrelation, reflect differences in the mode of transmission of cholera and dysentery. Our risk maps for cholera and dysentery incidences should help identifying putative factors of increased disease incidence, leading to more effective prevention and remedial actions in endemic areas.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Incidence rates are increasing in the United States. Monitoring incidence, survival, and mortality rates within at-risk populations can facilitate control efforts. Methods: Age-adjusted incidence trends for HCC were examined in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries from 1975 to 2005. Age-specific rates were examined for birth cohorts born between 1900 and 1959. Age-adjusted incidence and cause-specific survival rates from 1992 to 2005 were examined in the SEER 13 registries by race/ethnicity, stage, and treatment. United States liver cancer mortality rates were also examined. Results: Age-adjusted HCC incidence rates tripled between 1975 and 2005. Incidence rates increased in each 10-year birth cohort from 1900 through the 1950s. Asians/Pacific Islanders had higher incidence and mortality rates than other racial/ethnic groups, but experienced a significant decrease in mortality rates over time. From 2000 to 2005, marked increases in incidence rates occurred among Hispanic, black, and white middle-aged men. Between 1992 and 2004, 2- to 4-year HCC survival rates doubled, as more patients were diagnosed with localized and regional HCC and prognosis improved, particularly for patients with reported treatment. Recent 1-year survival rates remained, however, less than 50\%. Conclusion: HCC incidence and mortality rates continue to increase, particularly among middle-aged black, Hispanic, and white men. Screening of at-risk groups and treatment of localized-stage tumors may contribute to increasing HCC survival rates in the United States. More progress is needed.},

  abstract = {Background: Only a small amount of research has focused on the relationship between socio-economic status (SES) and geographic access to prescription medications at community pharmacies in North America and Europe. To examine the relationship between a community's socio-economic context and its residents' geographic access to common medications in pharmacies, we hypothesized that differences are present in access to pharmacies across communities with different socio-economic environments, and in availability of commonly prescribed medications within pharmacies located in communities with different socio-economic status. Methods: We visited 408 pharmacies located in 168 socio-economically diverse communities to assess the availability of commonly prescribed medications. We collected the following information at each pharmacy visited: hours of operation, pharmacy type, in-store medication availability, and the cash price of the 13 most commonly prescribed medications. We calculated descriptive statistics for the sample and fitted a series of hierarchical linear models to test our hypothesis that the in-stock availability of medications differs by the socio-economic conditions of the community. This was accomplished by modeling medication availability in pharmacies on the socio-economic factors operating at the community level in a socio-economically devise urban area. Results: Pharmacies in poor communities had significantly higher odds of medications being out of stock, OR=1.24, 95\% CI [1.02, 1.52]. There was also a significant difference in density of smaller, independent pharmacies with very limited stock and hours of operation, and larger, chain pharmacies in poor communities as compared to the middle and low-poverty communities. Conclusions: The findings suggest that geographic access to a neighborhood pharmacy, the type of pharmacy, and availability of commonly prescribed medications varies significantly across communities. In extreme cases, entire communities could be deemed " medication deserts " because geographic access to pharmacies and the availability of the most prescribed medications within them were very poor. To our knowledge, this study is first to report on the relationship between SES and geographic access to medications using small area econometric analysis techniques. Our findings should be reasonably generalizable to other urban areas in North America and Europe and suggest that more research is required to better understand the relationship of socio-economic environments and access to medications to develop strategies to achieve equitable medication access.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate injury risk associated with occupation and occupational physical demand levels among U.S. Army Soldiers. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Personal characteristics, physical fitness, military occupational specialty (MOS), and injury data were obtained by survey from Soldiers in an Army light infantry brigade (n = 2101). Odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) from a multivariate analysis assessing injury risk were calculated. RESULTS: Injury incidence for the prior 12 months was 43\%. Physical fitness and behavioral factors associated with injury risk included age 21-29 (OR [age 21-29/age {$\leq$} 20] = 1.37, 95\% CI 1.00-1.90), BMI 27.5-29.9 (high-overweight) (OR high-overweight/normal = 1.62, 95\% CI 1.20-2.18); BMI {$>$}29.9 (obese) (OR obese/normal = 1.73, 95\% CI 1.23-2.44), cigarette smoking (OR Smoker/Nonsmoker = 1.34, 95\% CI 1.11-1.63), and poor APFT two mile run performance (OR (Q4/Q1) = 1.61, 95\% CI 1.19-2.19). Higher risk of injury was associated with some MOSs (OR (Chemical, Explosives \& Ammunition/Infantry) = 2.82, 95\% CI 1.19-6.68; OR (Armor/Infantry) = 1.53, 95\% CI 1.13-2.07). CONCLUSION: This study identified a number of potentially modifiable risk factors for injuries including: maintenance of healthy weight, improved aerobic endurance, and reduction in smoking. Results also indicate certain Army occupations may be at higher risk of injury. Further investigation into reasons for their higher risk is warranted.},

METHODS: HSCT survivors (n = 662) were recruited through the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry/Autologous Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry and were drawn from 40 transplantation centers. HSCT survivors completed a telephone interview and a set of questionnaires a mean of 7.0 years post-HSCT (range, 1.8 to 22.6 years). Study measures included a variety of standardized measures of HRQOL and growth and spiritual well-being. An age- and sex-matched healthy comparison (HC) group (n = 158) was recruited using a peer nomination method. The HC group completed a parallel telephone interview and set of questionnaires. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis of variance analyses found the HSCT survivor group reported poorer status relative to the HC group for all HRQOL outcome clusters including physical health, physical functioning, social functioning, psychological adjustment, and dyadic adjustment. In contrast, the HSCT survivor group reported more psychological and interpersonal growth. Mean effect size for the 24 outcome indices examined was 0.36 standard deviations, an effect size often considered clinically meaningful or important. The largest group differences were found for measures of general health, physical function and well-being, depression, cognitive function, and fatigue. CONCLUSION: The experience of HSCT for a malignant disease has a wide-ranging, longstanding, and profound impact on adult recipients. Relative to healthy controls, HSCT survivors reported poorer physical, psychological, and social functioning but, conversely, more psychological and interpersonal growth, differences that appeared to persist many years after HSCT.},

  abstract = {Introduction               Despite gains in global coverage of childhood vaccines, many children remain undervaccinated. Although mass vaccination campaigns are commonly conducted to reach these children their effectiveness is unclear. We evaluated the effectiveness of a mass vaccination campaign in reaching zero-dose children.                                         Methods               We conducted a prospective study in 10 health centre catchment areas in Southern province, Zambia in November 2020. About 2 months before a national mass measles and rubella vaccination campaign conducted by the Ministry of Health, we used aerial satellite maps to identify built structures. These structures were visited and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) and measles zero-dose children were identified (children who had not received any DTP or measles-containing vaccines, respectively). After the campaign, households where measles zero-dose children were previously identified were targeted for mop-up vaccination and to assess if these children were vaccinated during the campaign. A Bayesian geospatial model was used to identify factors associated with zero-dose status and measles zero-dose children being reached during the campaign. We also produced fine-scale zero-dose prevalence maps and identified optimal locations for additional vaccination sites.                                         Results               Before the vaccination campaign, 17.3\% of children under 9 months were DTP zero-dose and 4.3\% of children 9--60 months were measles zero-dose. Of the 461 measles zero-dose children identified before the vaccination campaign, 338 (73.3\%) were vaccinated during the campaign and 118 (25.6\%) were reached by a targeted mop-up activity. The presence of other children in the household, younger age, greater travel time to health facilities and living between health facility catchment areas were associated with zero-dose status. Mapping zero-dose prevalence revealed substantial heterogeneity within and between catchment areas. Several potential locations were identified for additional vaccination sites.                                         Conclusion               Fine-scale variation in zero-dose prevalence and the impact of accessibility to healthcare facilities on vaccination coverage were identified. Geospatial modelling can aid targeted vaccination activities.},

  abstract = {Gating current (Ig) has been studied in relation to inactivation of Na channels. No component of Ig has the time course of inactivation; apparently little or no charge movement is associated with this step. Inactivation nonetheless affects Ig by immobilizing about two-thirds of gating charge. Immobilization can be followed by measuring ON charge movement during a pulse and comparing it to OFF charge after the pulse. The OFF:ON ratio is near 1 for a pulse so short that no inactivation occurs, and the ratio drops to about one-third with a time course that parallels inactivation. Other correlations between inactivation and immobilization are that: (a) they have the same voltage dependence; (b) charge movement recovers with the time coures of recovery from inactivation. We interpret this to mean that the immobilized charge returns slowly to "off" position with the time course of recovery from inactivation, and that the small current generated is lost in base-line noise. At -150 mV recover is very rapid, and the immobilized charge forms a distinct slow component of current as it returns to off position. After destruction of inactivation by pronase, there is no immobilization of charge. A model is presented in which inactivation gains its voltage dependence by coupling to the activation gate.},

The authors of this report hypothesized that these differences result from inequities in access to care and in response to therapy. METHODS: Patients with HCC (n = 20,920) were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, and patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCC (n = 4735) were identified from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database. Clinical and pathologic factors were compared after patients were stratified by race and ethnicity. RESULTS: The survival of patients with HCC improved over time for all racial, ethnic, and income groups (P {$<$} .001). Black and low income individuals had the poorest long-term survival (P {$<$} .001). On multivariate analysis, black race was predictive of the poorest survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.15; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.22; P {$<$} .001), whereas Asian race was associated with the best survival (HR, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.83-0.91; P {$<$} .001). After liver transplantation, black patients had the worst graft survival and overall survival (median survival [MS], 30.5 months and 39.7 months, respectively; P {$<$} .001), whereas Hispanics had the best survival (MS, 83.4 months and 86.6 months, respectively; P {$<$} .001). In a multivariate analysis of transplantation patients, race and ethnicity were associated significantly with outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Significant racial and ethnic disparities in the outcome of patients with HCC persist despite the receipt of comparable treatment. The authors concluded that further investigations are warranted to identify the reasons for the stark disparity in outcomes between black patients and Hispanic patients after liver transplantation for HCC.},

  abstract = {Introduction:\enspace{} The Bacille-Calmette--Guerin (BCG) vaccination remains the primary strategy to prevent severe disseminated TB in young children, particularly in high TB-burden countries such as Ethiopia. Accurate knowledge of vaccination coverage in small geographical areas is critically important to developing targeted immunization campaigns. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal distributions and ecological level determinants of BCG vaccination coverage in Ethiopia. Method:\enspace{} Bacille-Calmette--Guerin immunization coverage and geographical information data were obtained from five different Demographic and Health Surveys, conducted in Ethiopia between 2000 and 2019. Data for independent variables were obtained from publicly available sources. Bayesian geostatistical models were used to predict the spatial distribution of BCG vaccination coverage in Ethiopia. Result:\enspace{} The overall national BCG vaccination coverage between 2000 and 2019 was 65.5\%. The BCG vaccine coverage was 53.5\% in 2000, 56.9\% in 2005, 64.4\% in 2011, 79.6\% in 2016, and 79.0\% in 2019. BCG vaccination coverage increased by 47.6\% in Ethiopia from 2000 to 2019, but substantial geographical inequalities in BCG coverage remained at sub-national and local levels. High vaccination coverage was observed in northern, western, and central parts of Ethiopia. Climatic and demographic factors such as temperature, altitude, and population density were positively associated with BCG vaccination coverage. Whereas, healthcare access factors such as distance to health facilities and travel time to the nearest cities were negatively associated with BCG vaccine coverage in Ethiopia. Conclusion:\enspace{} Despite substantial progress in national BCG vaccination coverage, marked spatial variation in BCG coverage persists throughout the country at sub-national and local levels. Healthcare access and climatic and demographic factors determined the spatial distribution of BCG vaccination coverage. Maintaining a high level of vaccination coverage across geographical areas is important to prevent TB in Ethiopia.},

Methods: The Black Women's Health Study, a follow-up of 59,000 African-American women, began in 1995. Over 16~years 5344 incident cases of diabetes occurred during 576,577 person-years. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimated HRs and 95\% CIs for categories of `everyday racism' (interpersonal racism in daily life) and `lifetime racism' (reporting ever treated unfairly due to race with respect to police, housing or work) and incident type 2 diabetes. Models were adjusted for age, questionnaire cycle, marital status, socioeconomic status, education, family history of diabetes, physical activity, alcohol use and smoking status, with and without inclusion of terms for dietary patterns and adult BMI. Results: Compared with women in the lowest quartile of exposure, women in the highest quartile of exposure to everyday racism had a 31\% increased risk of diabetes (HR 1.31; 95\% CI 1.20, 1.42) and women with the highest exposure to lifetime racism had a 16\% increased risk (HR 1.16; 95\% CI 1.05, 1.27). Mediation analysis estimated that BMI accounted for half of the association between either the everyday or lifetime racism measure and incident diabetes. Conclusions/interpretation: Perceived everyday and lifetime racism were associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes in this cohort of African-American women and appear to be at least partly mediated by BMI.}

  abstract = {Oncolytic adenoviruses, such as ONYX-015, have been tested in clinical trials for currently untreatable tumors, but have yet to demonstrate adequate therapeutic efficacy. The extent to which viruses infect targeted cells determines the efficacy of this approach but many tumors down-regulate the Coxsackievirus and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR), rendering them less susceptible to infection. Disrupting MAPK pathway signaling by pharmacological inhibition of MEK up-regulates CAR expression, offering possible enhanced adenovirus infection. MEK inhibition, however, interferes with adenovirus replication due to resulting G1-phase cell cycle arrest. Therefore, enhanced efficacy will depend on treatment protocols that productively balance these competing effects. Predictive understanding of how to attain and enhance therapeutic efficacy of combinatorial treatment is difficult since the effects of MEK inhibitors, in conjunction with adenovirus/cell interactions, are complex nonlinear dynamic processes. We investigated combinatorial treatment strategies using a mathematical model that predicts the impact of MEK inhibition on tumor cell proliferation, ONYX-015 infection, and oncolysis. Specifically, we fit a nonlinear differential equation system to dedicated experimental data and analyzed the resulting simulations for favorable treatment strategies. Simulations predicted enhanced combinatorial therapy when both treatments were applied simultaneously; we successfully validated these predictions in an ensuing explicit test study. Further analysis revealed that a CAR-independent mechanism may be responsible for amplified virus production and cell death.

  abstract = {This article reviews the evidence on the chronic problem of fiscal disparities among city and suburban governments in metropolitan areas. There is a nexus between the fiscal disparities problem and the spatial mismatch problem---the suburbanization of jobs and housing discrimination have led to a surplus of workers relative to jobs in inner-city neighborhoods. One of these problems argues that there are market and discrimination constraints on the ability of the central-city population to realize its full potential in the job market, and that these constraints exacerbate the social problems that plague the city. The other argues that there are market and government policy constraints that limit the ability of urban governments to deliver adequate services at reasonable, competitive tax rates. There are no equilibrating forces in place that would reverse either disparity, and the policy options open to redress the imbalances are very limited.},

Primary outcome was a composite of serious clinical events postdelivery (ie, intensive care unit admission, death, hospital readmission related to IAI or endometritis within 30 days, additional surgery or procedures, or deep surgical site infection). Baseline characteristics between the pre- and post-cefoxitin groups were compared via Student's t tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables.

In this conceptual report, the third in a Series on equity and equality in health in the USA, we use a contemporary and historical perspective to discuss research and interventions that grapple with the implications of what is known as structural racism on population health and health inequities. Structural racism refers to the totality of ways in which societies foster racial discrimination through mutually reinforcing systems of housing, education, employment, earnings, benefits, credit, media, health care, and criminal justice. These patterns and practices in turn reinforce discriminatory beliefs, values, and distribution of resources. We argue that a focus on structural racism offers a concrete, feasible, and promising approach towards advancing health equity and improving population health.}

In the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC), we identified 201 HCC cases among 486,799 men/women, after a median follow-up of 11 years. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for HCC incidence in relation to quintiles/categories of coffee/tea intakes. We found that increased coffee and tea intakes were consistently associated with lower HCC risk. The inverse associations were substantial, monotonic and statistically significant. Coffee consumers in the highest compared to the lowest quintile had lower HCC risk by 72\% [HR: 0.28; 95\% confidence intervals (CIs): 0.16-0.50, p-trend {$<$} 0.001]. The corresponding association of tea with HCC risk was 0.41 (95\% CI: 0.22-0.78, p-trend = 0.003). There was no compelling evidence of heterogeneity of these associations across strata of important HCC risk factors, including hepatitis B or hepatitis C status (available in a nested case-control study). The inverse, monotonic associations of coffee intake with HCC were apparent for caffeinated (p-trend = 0.009), but not decaffeinated (p-trend = 0.45) coffee for which, however, data were available for a fraction of subjects. Results from this multicentre, European cohort study strengthen the existing evidence regarding the inverse association between coffee/tea and HCC risk. Given the apparent lack of heterogeneity of these associations by HCC risk factors and that coffee/tea are universal exposures, our results could have important implications for high HCC risk subjects.},

In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 in Western New York (WNY), integrating individual patient-level genomic sequencing data with a spatially informed agent-based disease Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) computational model. The integration of genomic and spatial data enables a multi-faceted exploration of the factors influencing the transmission patterns of COVID-19, including genetic variations in the viral genomes, population density, and movement dynamics in New York State (NYS). Our genomic analyses provide insights into the genetic heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 within a single lineage, at region-specific resolutions, while our population analyses provide models for SARS-CoV-2 lineage transmission. Together, our findings shed light on localized dynamics of the pandemic, revealing potential cross-county transmission networks. This interdisciplinary approach, bridging genomics and spatial modeling, contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of COVID-19 dynamics. The results of this study have implications for future public health strategies, including guiding targeted interventions and resource allocations to control the spread of similar viruses.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We aimed to examine the changes in ED utilization during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, in a country with a well-developed primary care system. Methods: A retrospective analysis of ED utilization was performed in 3 Dutch hospitals during a 60-day period, starting on February 15, 2020. The identical period in 2019 was used as a reference. ED visits were labeled as COVID-related (defined as COVID-19 suspected) or non-COVID-related. Admission rates were compared using chi-square tests, and the reduction in ED visits was assessed descriptively. Results: During the study period, daily ED volume was 18\% lower compared to that of 2019. ED utilization further declined (-29\%) during lockdown. Combined admission rates were higher in 2020 compared to those in 2019 (P {$<$} 0.001), and they were higher for COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 ED visits (P {$<$} 0.001). Conclusions: ED utilization was markedly reduced during the local rise of COVID-19 in a region with a welldeveloped primary care system and relatively low ED self-referral rates. Although it cannot directly be concluded from the findings of our study, this observation likely reflects a complex interaction between pure lockdown effects and viral fear, which warrants further research.},

The use if intranasal (i.n.) medications in high-risk populations may limit this risk of exposure. To determine the efficacy of i.n. naloxone in the treatment of suspected opiate overdose patients in the prehospital setting, a prospective, nonrandomized trial of administering i.n. naloxone by paramedics to patients with suspected opiate overdoses over a 6-month period was performed. All adult patients encountered in the prehospital setting as suspected opiate overdose (OD), found down (FD), or with altered mental status (AMS) who met the criteria for naloxone administration were included in the study. i.n. naloxone (2 mg) was administered immediately upon patient contact and before i.v. insertion and administration of i.v. naloxone (2 mg). Patients were then treated by EMS protocol. The main outcome measures were: time of i.n. naloxone administration, time of i.v. naloxone administration, time of appropriate patient response as reported by paramedics. Ninety-five patients received i.n. naloxone and were included in the study. A total of 52 patients responded to naloxone by either i.n. or i.v., with 43 (83\%) responding to i.n. naloxone alone. Seven patients (16\%) in this group required further doses of i.v. naloxone. In conclusion, i.n. naloxone is a novel alternative method for drug administration in high-risk patients in the prehospital setting with good overall effectiveness. The use of this route is further discussed in relation to efficacy of treatment and minimizing the risk of blood-borne exposures to EMS personnel.},

Coffee and, more recently, caffeine, have been found to have a beneficial effect in several disorders of the liver, including those manifesting abnormal liver biochemistry, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Caffeine acts directly by delaying fibrosis, thereby improving the function of liver cellular pathways and interfering with pathways used by the HCV replication cycle. In the current study, the direct relationship between caffeine and viral replication was evaluated. The Huh-7.5 cell line was used for transient infections with FL-J6/JFH-5'C19Rluc2AUbi and to establish a cell line stably expressing SGR-Feo JFH-1. Caffeine efficiently inhibited HCV replication in a dose-dependent manner at non-cytotoxic concentrations and demonstrated an IC50 value of 0.7263 mM after 48 h of incubation. These data demonstrate that caffeine may be an important new agent for anti-HCV therapies due to its efficient inhibition of HCV replication at non-toxic concentrations.},

  abstract = {Intersectionality theory, developed to address the non-additivity of effects of sex/gender and race/ethnicity but extendable to other domains, allows for the potential to study health and disease at different intersections of identity, social position, processes of oppression or privilege, and policies or institutional practices. Intersectionality has the potential to enrich population health research through improved validity and greater attention to both heterogeneity of effects and causal processes producing health inequalities. Moreover, intersectional population health research may serve to both test and generate new theories. Nevertheless, its implementation within health research to date has been primarily through qualitative research. In this paper, challenges to incorporation of intersectionality into population health research are identified or expanded upon. These include: 1) confusion of quantitative terms used metaphorically in theoretical work with similar-sounding statistical methods; 2) the question of whether all intersectional positions are of equal value, or even of sufficient value for study; 3) distinguishing between intersecting identities, social positions, processes, and policies or other structural factors; 4) reflecting embodiment in how processes of oppression and privilege are measured and analysed; 5) understanding and utilizing appropriate scale for interactions in regression models; 6) structuring interaction or risk modification to best convey effects, and 7) avoiding assumptions of equidistance or single level in the design of analyses. Addressing these challenges throughout the processes of conceptualizing and planning research and in conducting analyses has the potential to improve researchers' ability to more specifically document inequalities at varying intersectional positions, and to study the potential individual- and group-level causes that may drive these observed inequalities. A greater and more thoughtful incorporation of intersectionality can promote the creation of evidence that is directly useful in population-level interventions such as policy changes, or that is specific enough to be applicable within the social contexts of affected communities. ?? 2014 The Author.},

Using planned portions of the interstate highway system as a source of exogenous variation, empirical estimates indicate that one new highway passing through a central city reduces its population by about 18 percent. Esti- mates imply that aggregate central city population would have grown by about 8 percent had the interstate highway system not been built.},

Few published studies have systematically examined these sites. Objectives: The aim of this study was to employ content analysis as a useful tool for examining and comparing anti-vaccination websites for recurring and changing emphases in content, design, and credibility themes since earlier anti-vaccination website content analyses were conducted. Methods: Between February and May 2010, using a commonly available search engine followed by a deep web search, 25 websites that contained anti-vaccination content were reviewed and analyzed for 24 content, 14 design, and 13 credibility attributes. Results: Although several content claims remained similar to earlier analyses, two new themes emerged: (1) the 2009 H1N1 epidemic threat was " manufactured," and (2) the increasing presence of so-called " expert" testimony in opposing vaccination. Conclusion: Anti-vaccination websites are constantly changing in response to the trends in public health and the success of vaccination. Monitoring the changes can permit public health workers to mount programs more quickly to counter the opposition arguments. Additionally, opposition claims commonly appeal to emotions whereas the supporting claims appeal to reason. Effective vaccine support may be better served by including more emotionally compelling content. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Herein, we present the constraint-based reconstruction and analysis toolbox, a software package running in the Matlab environment, which allows for quantitative prediction of cellular behavior using a constraint-based approach. Specifically, this software allows predictive computations of both steady-state and dynamic optimal growth behavior, the effects of gene deletions, comprehensive robustness analyses, sampling the range of possible cellular metabolic states and the determination of network modules. Functions enabling these calculations are included in the toolbox, allowing a user to input a genome-scale metabolic model distributed in Systems Biology Markup Language format and perform these calculations with just a few lines of code. The results are predictions of cellular behavior that have been verified as accurate in a growing body of research. After software installation, calculation time is minimal, allowing the user to focus on the interpretation of the computational results.},

  abstract = {Introduction Transportation is a social determinant of health which affects how easily individuals attend clinic appointments, obtain medications, or seek emergency care. Despite the importance of transportation, there are few large-scale studies characterizing typical transportation behaviors related to seeking healthcare. This study investigates demographic differences in travel times and transportation mode for healthcare/medical related trips using the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) dataset and identifies potential access inequities. Methods Medical trip data was obtained from the 2017 NHTS dataset. All analysis was adjusted by survey weights. Multiple linear regression models were developed to investigate the relationships between demographic variables, transportation mode, and travel time. Additionally, a logistic regression model was used to investigate the relationship between demographics and transportation mode. Results Medical trips using public transportation were found to be significantly longer relative to personal automobile trips. Higher household income was found to be associated with shorter travel times, but the effect size decreased with the inclusion of transportation mode. Higher household income respondents were also likely to use public transportation. Respondent race was not significantly associated with any differences in travel times, but there were significant differences across races in public transportation use. Conclusions This study demonstrates that individuals with lower household incomes tended to have longer medical trips. Additionally, it identifies public transit to be a potential mediating factor for this difference, as lower-income residents were significantly more likely to use public transit. This analysis highlights the importance of maintaining accessible and efficient public transportation for access to healthcare, especially for populations which have traditionally been at-risk for health disparities.},

For pediatric patients, it was further complicated by the delayed timeline for authorizing the vaccine and the differences in dosing/products depending on the patient's age. This paper investigates the relationship between the spatial accessibility and uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in King County, WA, USA. Public data for COVID-19 vaccine sites were used to calculate spatial accessibility using an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) technique. Spatial regression analyses were performed to look at the relationship between spatial accessibility and ZIP-code-level vaccination rates. The relationships of these data with other socioeconomic and demographic variables were calculated as well. Higher rates of vaccine accessibility and vaccine coverage were found in adolescent (12- to 17-year-old) individuals relative to school-age (5- to 11-year-old) individuals. Vaccine accessibility was positively associated with coverage in both age groups in the univariable analysis. This relationship was affected by neighborhood educational attainment. This paper demonstrates how measures such as E2SFCA can be used to calculate the accessibility of the COVID-19 vaccine in a region and provides insight into some of the ecological factors that affect COVID-19 vaccination rates.},

MethodsCounty-level standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) of liver cancer in Wisconsin were calculated using traditional indirect adjustment methods for cases from 2003 to 2012. Tract-level SMRs were calculated using adaptive spatial filtering (ASF). The tract-level SMRs were checked for correlations to a socioeconomic advantage index (SEA) and percent racial composition. Non-spatial and spatial regression analyses with tract-level SMR as the outcome were conducted. ResultsCounty-level SMR estimates were shown to mask much of the variance within counties across their tracts. Liver cancer mortality was strongly correlated with the percent of Black residents in a census tract and moderately associated with SEA. In the multivariate spatially-adjusted regression analysis, only Percent Black composition remained significantly associated with an increased liver cancer SMR. ConclusionsUsing ASF, we developed a high-resolution map of liver cancer mortality in Wisconsin. This map provided details on the distribution of liver cancer that were inaccessible in the county-level map. These tract-level estimates were associated with several racial and socioeconomic variables.},

SETTING: University-based outpatient family planning clinic. PATIENTS: Sexually active adolescent girls younger than 18 years (N = 517) who presented for contraceptive care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of witnessing or experiencing violence and the associations with health-risk behaviors, including high-risk sexual behaviors, substance use, and self-injury. RESULTS: Compared with adolescents who had not been exposed to violence, those who had only witnessed violence were 2 to 3 times more likely to report using tobacco and marijuana, drinking alcohol or using drugs before sex, and having intercourse with a partner who had multiple partners. Those who had experienced, but not witnessed violence were at increased risk of these same behaviors and were 2 to 4 times more likely than those who had neither witnessed nor experienced violence to report early initiation of intercourse, intercourse with strangers, multiple partners, or partners with multiple partners, tobacco, alcohol and drug use, or to have positive test results for a sexually transmitted disease. Individuals who had both witnessed and experienced violence demonstrated the greatest risk of adverse health behaviors. These adolescents demonstrated 3 to 6 times greater risk of suicidal ideation (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-4.0) or suicide attempts (OR, 4.5; 95\% CI, 2.2-9.4), self-injury (OR, 5.8; 95\% CI, 2.6-12.9), and use of drugs before intercourse (OR, 6.2; 95\% CI, 3.0-12.9) than those who had neither witnessed nor experienced violence. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents exposed to violence are at increased risk of multiple adverse health behaviors. Programs designed to improve health outcomes should target this high-risk group.},

Plasma microbial cell-free DNA sequencing may improve diagnostic yield in immunocompromised patients with pneumonia. Methods. In this prospective, multicenter, observational study of immunocompromised adults undergoing bronchoscopy to establish a pneumonia etiology, plasma microbial cell-free DNA sequencing was compared to standardized usual care testing. Pneumonia etiology was adjudicated by a blinded independent committee. The primary outcome, additive diagnostic value, was assessed in the Per Protocol population (patients with complete testing results and no major protocol deviations) and defined as the percent of patients with an etiology of pneumonia exclusively identified by plasma microbial cell-free DNA sequencing. Clinical additive diagnostic value was assessed in the Per Protocol subgroup with negative usual care testing. Results. Of 257 patients, 173 met Per Protocol criteria. A pneumonia etiology was identified by usual care in 52/173 (30.1\%), plasma microbial cell-free DNA sequencing in 49/173 (28.3\%) and the combination of both in 73/173 (42.2\%) patients. Plasma microbial cell-free DNA sequencing exclusively identified an etiology of pneumonia in 21/173 patients (additive diagnostic value 12.1\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI], 7.7\% to 18.0\%, P {$<$} .001). In the Per Protocol subgroup with negative usual care testing, plasma microbial cell-free DNA sequencing identified a pneumonia etiology in 21/121 patients (clinical additive diagnostic value 17.4\%, 95\% CI, 11.1\% to 25.3\%). Conclusions. Non-invasive plasma microbial cell-free DNA sequencing significantly increased diagnostic yield in immunocompromised patients with pneumonia undergoing bronchoscopy and extensive microbiologic and molecular testing.

For infectious disease models, failure to ensure identifiability can lead to misleading parameter estimates and unreliable policy recommendations. We examine the identifiability of a modified SIR model that accounts for under-reporting and pre-existing immunity in the population. We provide a mathematical proof of the unidentifiability of jointly estimating three parameters: the fraction under-reporting, the proportion of the population with prior immunity, and the community transmission rate, when only reported case data are available. We then show, analytically and with a simulation study, that the identifiability of all three parameters is achieved if the reported incidence is complemented with sample survey data of prior immunity or prevalence during the outbreak. Our results show the limitations of parameter inference in partially observed epidemics and the importance of identifiability analysis when developing and applying models for public health decision making.},

Breast and colorectal cancer, in particular, have been shown to exhibit significant disparities and contribute a large proportion of morbidity and mortality from cancer. In addition, breast and colorectal cancer offer targets for prevention and control, including nutrition, physical activity, screening, and effective treatments to prolong and enhance the quality of survival. However, despite the investment of significant time and resources over many years, breast and colorectal cancer disparities persist, and in some cases, may be growing. Methods: This paper examines breast and colorectal cancer survival disparities in an 8-county region in southeastern Wisconsin, including the City of Milwaukee. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine survival trends, and a new adaptation of adaptive spatial filtering-a disease mapping method-was used to examine spatial patterns of survival. Results: Disparities by race and ethnicity are revealed, and spatial analyses identify specific areas within the study region that have lower than expected survival rates. Conclusions: Cancer control efforts in southeastern Wisconsin should focus on black/African American and Hispanic/Latina women to reduce breast cancer survival disparities, and black/ frican American populations to reduce colorectal cancer disparities. Evidence indicates that targeted interventions may be needed to serve populations in the Milwaukee and Kenosha metropolitan areas, as well as areas of Walworth, Ozaukee, and Waukesha counties.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: A growing body of work examines the association between neighborhood environment and intimate partner violence (IPV). As in the larger literature examining the influence of place context on health, rural settings are understudied and urban and rural residential environments are rarely compared. In addition, despite increased attention to the linkages between neighborhood environment and IPV, few studies have examined the influence of neighborhood context on intimate partner femicide (IPF). In this paper, we examine the role for neighborhood-level factors in differentiating urban and rural IPFs in Wisconsin, USA.; METHODS: We use a combination of Wisconsin Violent Death Reporting System (WVDRS) data and Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence (WCADV) reports from 2004 to 2008, in concert with neighborhood-level information from the US Census Bureau and US Department of Agriculture, to compare urban and rural IPFs.; FINDINGS: Rates of IPF vary based on degree of rurality, and bivariate analyses show differences between urban and rural victims in race/ethnicity, marital status, country of birth, and neighborhood characteristics. After controlling for individual characteristics, the nature of the residential neighborhood environment significantly differentiates urban and rural IPFs.; CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a different role for neighborhood context in affecting intimate violence risk in rural settings, and that different measures may be needed to capture the qualities of rural environments that affect intimate violence risk. Our findings reinforce the argument that multilevel strategies are required to understand and reduce the burden of intimate violence, and that interventions may need to be crafted for specific geographical contexts. 2013 National Rural Health Association.},

  abstract = {Health is increasingly understood as a product of multiple levels of influence, from individual biological and behavioral influences to community and societal level contextual influences. In understanding these contextual influences, community health researchers have increasingly employed both geographic methodologies, including Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and community participatory approaches. However, despite growing interest in the role for community participation and local knowledge in community health investigations, and the use of geographical methods and datasets in characterizing community environments, there exist few examples of research projects that incorporate both geographical and participatory approaches in addressing health questions. This is likely due in part to concerns and restrictions regarding community access to confidential health data. In order to overcome this barrier, we present a method for linking confidential, geocoded health information with community-generated experiential geographical information in a GIS environment. We use sophisticated disease mapping methodologies to create continuously defined maps of colorectal cancer in Iowa, then incorporate these layers in an open source GIS application as the context for a participatory community mapping exercise with participants from a rural Iowa town. Our method allows participants to interact directly with health information at a fine geographical scale, facilitating hypothesis generation regarding contextual influences on health, while simultaneously protecting data confidentiality. Participants are able to use their local, geographical knowledge to generate hypotheses about factors influencing colorectal cancer risk in the community and opportunities for risk reduction. This work opens the door for future efforts to integrate empirical epidemiological data with community generated experiential information to inform community health research and practice.},

Statewide maps of colorectal cancer burdens show a place-based disparity in colorectal cancer in the region surrounding a small, diverse Iowa community. Within a research partnership framework, we use these maps to engage community residents in discussions of high colorectal cancer rates. We ask how a rural community experiencing higher than expected rates of colorectal cancer late-stage diagnosis and mortality perceives and explains their increased risk, interpreting available epidemiological evidence based on their lived experience. We use concept mapping to organize these perceptions and situate our findings in the context of previous work. Our findings reveal a complex understanding of risk that should be taken into account in crafting effective public health interventions and messages.

Multivariate survey regression analyses examine the association between green space and mental health using the unique, population-based Survey of the Health of Wisconsin database. Analyses were adjusted for length of residence in the neighborhood to reduce the impact of neighborhood selection bias. Higher levels of neighborhood green space were associated with significantly lower levels of symptomology for depression, anxiety and stress, after controlling for a wide range of confounding factors.

When combined with community participation, geographic information systems approaches, such as the creation of disease maps that connect disease rates with community context, can catalyze action to reduce health disparities. However, current approaches to disease mapping often focus on the display of disease rates for political or administrative units. This type of map does not provide enough information on the local rates of cancer to engage community participation in addressing disparities.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: We collaborated with researchers and cancer prevention and control practitioners and used adaptive spatial filtering to create maps that show continuous surface representations of the proportion of all colorectal cancer cases diagnosed in the late stage. We also created maps that show the incidence of colorectal cancer.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Our maps show distinct patterns of cancer and its relationship to community context. The maps are available to the public on the Internet and through the activities of Iowa Consortium for Comprehensive Cancer Control partners.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Community-participatory approaches to research are becoming more common, as are the availability of geocoded data and the use of geographic information systems to map disease. If researchers and practitioners are to engage communities in exploring cancer rates, maps should be made that accurately represent and contextualize cancer in such a way as to be useful to people familiar with the characteristics of their local areas.},

Some neighborhood characteristics-particularly area level socioeconomic factors-have been linked to cancer screening behavior, but few studies have examined the relationship between perceived neighborhood quality and screening behavior, which may provide more insight into the ways in which neighborhood environments shape cancer related behaviors. This study examines the relationship between several aspects of the perceived neighborhood environment and breast and colorectal cancer screening behavior among a population-based sample of Wisconsin residents. A sub-goal was to compare the relevance of different perceived neighborhood factors for different screening tests. This is a cross-sectional study of 2008-2012 data from the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin, a population-based annual survey of Wisconsin residents. An average risk sample of Black, Hispanic and White women age 50 and older (n = 1265) were selected. Survey regression analyses examined predictors of screening, as well as adherence to screening guidelines. Models controlled for individual socio-demographic information and insurance status. Perceptions of social and physical disorder, including fear of crime and visible garbage, were associated with screening rates. Findings emphasize the particular importance of these factors for colorectal cancer screening, indicating the necessity of improving screening rates in areas characterized by social disorganization, crime, and physical disorder. Additional work should be done to further investigate the pathways that explain the linkage between neighborhood conditions, perceived neighborhood risks and cancer screening behavior.},

  abstract = {There is currently much interest in designing synthetic substrates incorporating the cell binding motif RGD for tissue engineering. In this paper, hepatocyte function was examined on two synthetic RGD substrates and compared to that on fibronectin (Fn). One is a 2.3 kD RGD peptide (P-2) containing a single RGD, a short spacer in the middle and an end basic sequence to enhance adsorption. On bacteriological plastic, P-2 induced a rounded cell shape, enhanced differentiated function, and inhibited DNA synthesis. The other, a 73 kD synthetic RGD protein Pronectin F (PnF), contains repeating RGD units interspersed with a structural peptide. PnF induced cell spreading, dedifferentiation, and enhanced DNA synthesis, similar to Fn. In addition, only P-2 showed distinct differences in cell shape and DNA synthesis when coated on bacteriological plastic, or on Immulon II plastic, both intrinsically non-adhesive to cells. On bacteriologic plates coated with P-2, cells were round and showed diminished DNA synthesis while on Immulon II plates, they were spread and showed enhanced DNA synthesis. These results demonstrate that synthetic RGD peptides can induce very different hepatocyte function depending on the context in which they are presented to cells. It is likely that the RGD peptide conformation determines the specificity of cellular response.},

  abstract = {Surgical site infections (SSIs), which are a potential complications in surgical procedures, are associated with prolonged hospital stays and increased postoperative mortality rates, and they also have a significant economic impact on health systems. Data in literature regarding risk factors for SSIs in pediatric age are scarce, with consequent difficulties in the management of SSI prophylaxis and with antibiotic prescribing attitudes in the various surgical procedures that often tend to follow individual opinions. The lack of pediatric studies is even more evident when we consider surgeries performed in subjects with underlying conditions that may pose an increased risk of complications. In order to respond to this shortcoming, we developed a consensus document to define optimal surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis (SAP) in neonates and children with specific high-risk conditions. These included the following: (1) colonization by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and by multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria other than MRSA; (2) allergy to first-line antibiotics; (3) immunosuppression; (4) splenectomy; (5) comorbidity; (6) ongoing antibiotic therapy or prophylaxis; (7) coexisting infection at another site; (8) previous surgery in the last month; and (9) presurgery hospitalization lasting more than 2 weeks. This work, made possible by the multidisciplinary contribution of experts belonging to the most important Italian scientific societies, represents, in our opinion, the most up-to-date and comprehensive collection of recommendations relating to behaviors to be undertaken in a perioperative site in the presence of specific categories of patients at high-risk of complications during surgery. The application of uniform and shared protocols in these high-risk categories will improve surgical practice with a reduction in SSIs and consequent rationalization of resources and costs, as well as being able to limit the phenomenon of antimicrobial resistance.},

Multidrug-resistant organisms have not only emerged in the hospital environment but are now often identified in community settings, suggesting that reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant bacteria are present outside the hospital. The bacterial response to the antibiotic "attack" is the prime example of bacterial adaptation and the pinnacle of evolution. "Survival of the fittest" is a consequence of an immense genetic plasticity of bacterial pathogens that trigger specific responses that result in mutational adaptations, acquisition of genetic material, or alteration of gene expression producing resistance to virtually all antibiotics currently available in clinical practice. Therefore, understanding the biochemical and genetic basis of resistance is of paramount importance to design strategies to curtail the emergence and spread of resistance and to devise innovative therapeutic approaches against multidrug-resistant organisms. In this chapter, we will describe in detail the major mechanisms of antibiotic resistance encountered in clinical practice, providing specific examples in relevant bacterial pathogens.},

  abstract = {Endogenous retroviral sequences provide a molecular fossil record of ancient infections whose analysis might illuminate mechanisms of viral extinction. A close relative of gammaretroviruses, HERV-T, circulated in primates for \textasciitilde 25 million years (MY) before apparent extinction within the past \textasciitilde 8 MY. Construction of a near-complete catalog of HERV-T fossils in primate genomes allowed us to estimate a \textasciitilde 32 MY old ancestral sequence and reconstruct a functional envelope protein (ancHTenv) that could support infection of a pseudotyped modern gammaretrovirus. Using ancHTenv, we identify monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT-1) as a receptor used by HERV-T for attachment and infection. A single HERV-T provirus in hominid genomes includes an env gene (hsaHTenv) that has been uniquely preserved. This apparently exapted HERV-T env could not support virion infection but could block ancHTenv mediated infection, by causing MCT-1 depletion from cell surfaces. Thus, hsaHTenv may have contributed to HERV-T extinction, and could also potentially regulate cellular metabolism.           ,              Over millions of years, viruses and the animals that they infect have been locked in a battle for survival, where each has needed to evolve ways to counteract the effects of the other. While the evolution of ancient animals can be studied by looking at the fossilized remains of their extinct relatives, studying how ancient viruses have evolved is more difficult as they usually do not leave behind physical traces of their existence. However, a family of viruses called retroviruses is a notable exception to this rule.             Retroviruses have a step in their life cycle in which their genetic material is integrated into the genome (the name for an organism's complete set of genetic material) of the cell that they have infected. In rare cases, when that cell is a precursor of a sperm or egg cell, then the viral genes may then be passed on to the animal's offspring, ultimately leaving genetic traces that can be studied in modern animals. This acts as a genetic `fossil record' of extinct viruses.             HERV-T was a retrovirus that spread among our primate ancestors for about 25 million years before its extinction roughly 11 million years ago. Blanco-Melo et al. have now analyzed the genetic remains left by HERV-T in the genomes of humans and related primates, and were able to use this information to recreate a protein that made up the outer envelope that surrounded the virus. Further experiments showed that this viral protein helped HERV-T to infect human cells by interacting with a protein called MCT1 on the cell surface.             Blanco-Melo et al. also found a particular HERV-T gene that was unexpectedly well preserved in the human genome. The gene retained its ability to produce an envelope protein for about 13 to 19 million years. It is likely that ancient primates `hijacked' the viral gene and used the protein it produced to remove the MCT1 protein from the surface of their own cells. Without MCT1 on the surface, HERV-T was unable to infect the cells. Thus, these findings present an example of how viruses themselves can provide the genetic material that animals use to combat them, potentially leading to their extinction.},

Despite the absence of any clearly related gene or activity, we describe possible scenarios by which tetherin arose that exemplify how protein modularity, evolvability, and robustness can create and preserve new functions. We find that tetherin genes in various organisms exhibit no sequence similarity and share only a common architecture and location in modern genomes. Moreover, tetherin is part of a cluster of three potential sister genes encoding proteins of similar architecture, some variants of which exhibit antiviral activity while others can be endowed with antiviral activity by a simple modification. Only in slowly evolving species (e.g., coelacanths) does tetherin exhibit sequence similarity to one potential sister gene. Neofunctionalization, drift, and genetic conflict appear to have driven a near complete loss of sequence similarity among modern tetherin genes and their sister genes.},

  abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 evolves rapidly in part because of its high mutation rate. Here, we examine whether this mutational process itself has changed during viral evolution. To do this, we quantify the relative rates of different types of single-nucleotide mutations at 4-fold degenerate sites in the viral genome across millions of human SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We find clear shifts in the relative rates of several types of mutations during SARS-CoV-2 evolution. The most striking trend is a roughly 2-fold decrease in the relative rate of G{$\rightarrow$}T mutations in Omicron versus early clades, as was recently noted by Ruis et al. (2022. Mutational spectra distinguish SARS-CoV-2 replication niches. bioRxiv, doi:10.1101/2022.09.27.509649). There is also a decrease in the relative rate of C{$\rightarrow$}T mutations in Delta, and other subtle changes in the mutation spectrum along the phylogeny. We speculate that these changes in the mutation spectrum could arise from viral mutations that affect genome replication, packaging, and antagonization of host innate-immune factors, although environmental factors could also play a role. Interestingly, the mutation spectrum of Omicron is more similar than that of earlier SARS-CoV-2 clades to the spectrum that shaped the long-term evolution of sarbecoviruses. Overall, our work shows that the mutation process is itself a dynamic variable during SARS-CoV-2 evolution and suggests that human SARS-CoV-2 may be trending toward a mutation spectrum more similar to that of other animal sarbecoviruses.},

We examined the association between previous splenectomy and the risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation, and death using a logistic regression model. Results: We identified 165,623 individuals with a positive COVID-19 test and 493,300 matched controls. Mean age was 38 years. 130 and 422 splenectomies were performed in the COVID-19 positive individuals and controls, respectively. Splenectomized patients did not have a higher risk of COVID-19 infection than non-splenectomized patients (adjusted OR: 0.89; 95\% CI: 0.73-1.08). Among COVID-19 positive individuals, splenectomized patients may have an increased risk of hospitalisation or death (adjusted OR for combined endpoint: 1.44; 95\% CI: 0.79--2.61). Conclusions: Splenectomized patients are not at an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, but they may have a higher risk of hospitalisation or death among COVID-19 positive individuals. This may be attributed to higher comorbidity levels.},

  abstract = {Transport across the plasma membrane is the first, obligatory step of hexose utilization. In yeast cells the uptake of hexoses is mediated by a large family of related transporter proteins. In baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the genes of 20 different hexose transporter-related proteins have been identified. Six of these transmembrane proteins mediate the metabolically relevant uptake of glucose, fructose and mannose for growth, two others catalyze the transport of only small amounts of these sugars, one protein is a galactose transporter but also able to transport glucose, two transporters act as glucose sensors, two others are involved in the pleiotropic drug resistance process, and the functions of the remaining hexose transporter-related proteins are not yet known. The catabolic hexose transporters exhibit different affinities for their substrates, and expression of their corresponding genes is controlled by the glucose sensors according to the availability of carbon sources. In contrast, milk yeast Kluyveromyces lactis contains only a few different hexose transporters. Genes of other monosaccharide transporter-related proteins have been found in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and in the xylose-fermenting yeast Pichia stipitis. However, the molecular genetics of hexose transport in many other yeasts remains to be established. The further characterization of this multigene family of hexose transporters should help to elucidate the role of transport in yeast sugar metabolism.},

We aimed at systematically reviewing the incidence and prevalence rates, as well as geographical distribution and temporal trends of PSC and PBC. Data sources: A systematic search of literature was performed in Medline and EMBASE (search last conducted January 10th, 2011). Study selection: Population-based epidemiological studies reporting incidence and/or prevalence rates for PSC or PBC in a defined geographical area of at least 100,000 adult inhabitants were considered relevant. Data extraction: Study area, study period, number of patients, number of inhabitants, incidence per 100,000 inhabitants per year, prevalence per 100,000 inhabitants, method of case-finding, method of case-ascertainment, male/female ratio and in case of PSC, occurrence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) were extracted from retrieved articles. Results: The literature search yielded 2286 abstracts of which 31 articles fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Studies varied in size from 10 to 770 patients in catchment areas from 100,312 to 19,230,000 inhabitants. The incidence and prevalence rates for PSC range from 0 to 1.3 per 100,000 inhabitants/year and 0-16.2 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. PBC incidence rates range from 0.33 to 5.8 per 100,000 inhabitants/year and prevalence rates range from 1.91 to 40.2 per 100,000 inhabitants; prevalence rates are increasing in time. Conclusions: Incidence and prevalence rates of both PSC and PBC vary widely and seem to be increasing. True population-based studies are scarce and therefore large population-based studies combining meticulous case-finding and case-ascertainment strategies are necessary. \copyright{} 2012 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

These associations were similarly positive in Whites but not significant.

It is increasingly appreciated that some evolutionary questions can only be adequately answered by combining evidence from multiple independent sources of data, including genome sequences, sampling dates, phenotypic data, radiocarbon dates, fossil occurrences, and biogeographic range information among others. Including all relevant data into a single joint model is very challenging both conceptually and computationally. Advanced computational software packages that allow robust development of compatible (sub-)models which can be composed into a full model hierarchy have played a key role in these developments. Developing such software frameworks is increasingly a major scientific activity in its own right, and comes with specific challenges, from practical software design, development and engineering challenges to statistical and conceptual modelling challenges. BEAST 2 is one such computational software platform, and was first announced over 4 years ago. Here we describe a series of major new developments in the BEAST 2 core platform and model hierarchy that have occurred since the first release of the software, culminating in the recent 2.5 release.},

Public health's commitment to social justice makes it a natural fit with intersectionality's focus on multiple historically oppressed populations. Yet despite a plethora of research focused on these populations, public health studies that reflect intersectionality in their theoretical frameworks, designs, analyses, or interpretations are rare. Accordingly, I describe the history and central tenets of intersectionality, address some theoretical and methodological challenges, and highlight the benefits of intersectionality for public health theory, research, and policy.},

However, there is considerable controversy as to whether these differences in diagnosis and survival are attributable to race or socioeconomic status. Our goal was to disentangle the influence of race and socioeconomic status on breast cancer stage, treatment, and survival. METHODS: We linked data from the Metropolitan Detroit Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)(1) registry to Michigan Medicaid enrollment files and identified 5719 women diagnosed with breast cancer, of whom 593 were insured by Medicaid. We first calculated the unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) associated with race, Medicaid insurance, and poverty for breast cancer stage at diagnosis, breast cancer treatment, and death. We then estimated the ORs of having late-stage breast cancer at diagnosis, breast-conserving surgery, no surgery, and death using logistic regression after controlling for clinical and nonclinical factors. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Before controlling for Medicaid enrollment and poverty, African-American women had a higher likelihood than white women of each unfavorable breast cancer outcome. However, after controlling for covariates, African-American women were not statistically significantly different from white women on most outcomes except for surgical choice. African-American women were more likely than white women to have no surgery (adjusted OR = 1.62; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11 to 2.37). Among women who had surgery, African-American women were more likely to have breast-conserving surgery than were white women (adjusted OR = 1.63; 95\% CI = 1.33 to 1.98). CONCLUSIONS: The linkage of Medicaid and SEER data provides more in-depth information on low-income women than has been available in past studies. In our Metropolitan Detroit study population, race was not statistically significantly associated with unfavorable breast cancer outcomes. However, low socioeconomic status was associated with late-stage breast cancer at diagnosis, type of treatment received, and death.},

We find that the loss of manufacturing jobs, especially steel jobs, triggered a rise in AFDC recipiency rates. The growth in service jobs during the period does little to offset the negative impact of lost steel jobs. We further find that the deleterious impact of lost steel jobs on AFDC recipiency is greatest after 1980, the period of heaviest job loss in Lake County's steel industry. These results persist even after including several control variables that represent plausible alternative explanations for Lake County's rise in AFDC recipiency.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Coffee consumption has been suggested to reduce the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed a meta-analysis of epidemiological studies to provide updated information on how coffee drinking affects HCC risk. METHODS: We performed a PubMed/MEDLINE search of the original articles published in English from 1966 through September 2012, on case-control or cohort studies that associated coffee consumption with liver cancer or HCC. We calculated the summary relative risk (RR) for any, low, and high consumption of coffee vs no consumption. The cut-off point for low vs high consumption was set to 3 cups per day in 9 studies and 1 cup per day in 5 studies. RESULTS: The summary RR for any coffee consumption vs no consumption was 0.60 from 16 studies, comprising a total of 3153 HCC cases (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.71); the RRs were 0.56 from 8 case-control studies (95\% CI, 0.42-0.75) and 0.64 from 8 cohort studies (95\% CI, 0.52-0.78). Compared with no coffee consumption, the summary RR was 0.72 (95\% CI, 0.61-0.84) for low consumption and 0.44 (95\% CI, 0.39-0.50) for high consumption. The summary RR was 0.80 (95\% CI, 0.77-0.84) for an increment of 1 cup of coffee per day. The inverse relationship between coffee and HCC risk was consistent regardless of the subjects' sex, alcohol drinking, or history of hepatitis or liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: From this meta-analysis, the risk of HCC is reduced by 40\% for any coffee consumption vs no consumption. The inverse association might partly or largely exist because patients with liver and digestive diseases reduce their coffee intake. However, coffee has been shown to affect liver enzymes and development of cirrhosis, and therefore could protect against liver carcinogenesis.},

  abstract = {Human embryonic lung fibroblasts (LU) can be productively infected with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). During the course of productive infection, the virus elicits a number of responses that resemble certain aspects of G1 cell cycle progression. The virus activates cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase in both subconfluent, serum-arrested, and density-arrested cultures. Activation of cyclin E-dependent kinase is due, in part, to induction of cyclin E and, in part, to inhibition of the cyclin kinase inhibitors, Cip1 and Kip1. However, G1 progression is incomplete in HCMV-infected cells.

They are useful as part of analyses for evaluating model results and then at the end of a project when researchers present their results and conclusions to varied audiences, such as their local research group, decision makers, or a concerned public. Cancer researchers are gaining skill with geographic information system (GIS) mapping as one of their many tools and are broadening the symbolization approaches they use for investigating and illustrating their data. A single map is one of many possible representations of the data, so making multiple maps is often part of a complete mapping effort. Symbol types, color choices, and data classing each affect the information revealed by a map and are best tailored to the specific characteristics of data. Related data can be examined in series with coordinated classing and can also be compared using multivariate symbols that build on the basic rules of symbol design. Informative legend wording and setting suitable map projections are also basic to skilled mapmaking.},

I document a significantly higher degree of take-up (and less crowding out of private insurance) among first- and second-generation immigrant children than among children of U.S. natives. Eligibility expansions increased immigrant children's use of preventive and ambulatory care and decreased emergency care in hospitals, while estimated effects for children of natives are negligible.

To quantify the effect of underutilization of screening by current smokers on the overall breast cancer and CRC screening prevalence in each state, we derived a cancer screening underutilization (CSU) measure.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: CRC screening rates among adults aged 50 years and older ranged from 38.3\% in Oklahoma to 59.5\% in Rhode Island for current smokers and from 58.0\% in Idaho to 75.9\% in New Hampshire for nonsmokers. Mammography rates among women aged 40 years and older ranged from 26.8\% in Utah to 63.6\% in the District of Columbia for current smokers and from 50.8\% in Utah to 73.0\% in Massachusetts for nonsmokers. As a result, CSU values ranged from 2.1\% to 6.7\% for CRC screening and from 0.3\% to 7.9\% for mammography. Most states with the largest CSU values were located in the South or Midwest, whereas those with the smallest CSU values were located in the Northeast or West.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Lower levels of CRC and mammography screening among current smokers substantially contribute to many states' lower overall screening prevalence, particularly in Southern and Midwestern states where smoking prevalence is highest. These findings underscore the potential for more concentrated efforts to promote cessation and screening among smokers as a means to achieving cancer screening goals.},

We postulate that metastases are influenced by the liver microenvironment. Here, we show that a unique inflammation/immune response-related signature is associated with noncancerous hepatic tissues from metastatic HCC patients. This signature is principally different from that of the tumor. A global Th1/Th2-like cytokine shift in the venous metastasis-associated liver microenvironment coincides with elevated expression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1). Moreover, a refined 17 gene signature was validated as a superior predictor of HCC venous metastases in an independent cohort, when compared to other clinical prognostic parameters. We suggest that a predominant humoral cytokine profile occurs in the metastatic liver milieu and that a shift toward anti-inflammatory/immune-suppressive responses may promote HCC metastases. \copyright{} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Treatment data on all patients who started OMT in Norway between 1997 and 2003 (n = 3221) were cross-linked with national criminal records. The period of observation was divided into four phases; pre-treatment, in-treatment, between treatments and post-treatment. FINDINGS: During OMT, rates of criminal convictions for the cohort were reduced to fewer than half of waiting-list levels [incidence rate (IR) 0.63 versus 1.57]. Patients in continuous treatment had the fewest convictions (IR 0.47) during treatment. The highest rates were found among patients out of treatment after several treatment episodes (IR 1.52). All groups had significantly fewer criminal convictions during treatment compared to before treatment. Staying in OMT for 2 years or more was associated with significantly reduced rates of convictions during treatment. Younger age and pre-treatment criminal convictions were associated with significantly (P {$<$} 0.001) more convictions during treatment. Those who left treatment, permanently or temporarily, relapsed into high levels of convictions outside treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Criminal activity appears to be reduced in Norway during opiate maintenance treatment. Younger age and prior history of criminal activity are important risk factors for continued criminal activity during treatment.},

HGF binding to endothelial cells identifies two sites with different affinities. The higher affinity binding site (Kd = 0.35 nM) corresponds to the p190MET receptor. Sub-nanomolar concentrations of HGF, but not of a recombinant inactive precursor, stimulate the receptor kinase activity, cell proliferation and motility. HGF induces repairs of a wound in endothelial cell monolayer. HGF stimulates the scatter of endothelial cells grown on three-dimensional collagen gels, inducing an elongated phenotype. In the rabbit cornea, highly purified HGF promotes neovascularization at sub-nanomolar concentrations. HGF lacks activities related to hemostasis-thrombosis, inflammation and endothelial cells accessory functions.

Novel lineages have the potential to spread rapidly and internationally if they have higher intrinsic transmissibility and/or can evade host immune responses, as has been seen with the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants of concern. They can also cause increased mortality and morbidity if they have increased virulence, as was seen for Alpha and Delta. Phylogenetic methods provide the ``gold standard'' for representing the global diversity of SARS-CoV-2 and to identify newly emerging lineages. However, these methods are computationally expensive, struggle when datasets get too large, and require manual curation to designate new lineages. These challenges provide a motivation to develop complementary methods that can incorporate all of the genetic data available without down-sampling to extract meaningful information rapidly and with minimal curation. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of using algorithmic approaches based on word-statistics to represent whole sequences, bringing speed, scalability, and interpretability to the construction of genetic topologies. While not serving as a substitute for current phylogenetic analyses, the proposed methods can be used as a complementary, and fully automatable, approach to identify and confirm new emerging variants.},

In this study, the two nuclear petite yeast mutants K1Deltapet191a and K1Deltapet191ab and their parental industrial strain K1 were cultured in glucose-containing microaerobic chemostats. Exometabolomic profiles were used to infer the differences in the fermentation characteristics and respiration capacity of the strains. The ability of the metabolite measurement information to describe genetically different strains was investigated using a genome-scale yeast model. Flux balance analysis (FBA) of the model reveals that the objective function of minimal oxygen consumption enables the identification of the effect of genotypic differences when combined with the knowledge of the extracellular state of metabolism. The predicted decrease in oxygen consumption flux of K1Deltapet191a and K1Deltapet191ab strains with respect to the parental strain is about 80\% and 100\%, respectively, which coincides with the respiratory deficiencies of the strains. The expected increase in ethanol production rates in response to the decrease in the respiratory capacity was also predicted to be very close to the experimental values. This study shows the predictive power of the integrated analysis of genome-scale models with exometabolomic profiles, since accurate predictions could be made without any information about the respiration capacity of the strains. The FBA approach thereby enables identification of responsive pathways and so permits the elucidation of the genetic characteristics of strains in terms of expressed metabolite profiles.},

Our purpose was to examine if there are patterns of gender differences in the type of medical service used among older Americans. Methods: We conducted a prospective study of 9164 Americans aged {$\geq$} 65 followed through the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a national probability sample of community dwelling adults. Self-reported medical utilization between 2002 and 2004 was modeled as a function of 2002 baseline characteristics of the sample. Results: Health needs were substantially greater among older women compared with men, but women had fewer economic resources. Controlling for health needs did little to explain gender differences in preventive care and increased gender differences in the use of hospital services. Women were less likely to have hospital stays (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.79) and had fewer physician visits (3.07 vs. 3.30 median visits within 2 years) than men with similar demographic and health profiles. In contrast, the greater use of home healthcare among women was almost entirely explained by their greater health needs. Conclusions: These national data show that simple evaluations of age-adjusted gender differences in the use of hospital and physician services that do not account for underlying health needs are in danger of understating these disparities.

  abstract = {Incidence rates for liver cancer have increased 3-fold since the mid-1970s in the United States in parallel with increasing trends for obesity and type II diabetes mellitus. We conducted an analysis of baseline body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and type II diabetes mellitus with risk of liver cancer. The Liver Cancer Pooling Project maintains harmonized data from 1.57 million adults enrolled in 14 U.S.-based prospective studies. Cox regression estimated HRs and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for age, sex, study center, alcohol, smoking, race, and BMI (for WC and type II diabetes mellitus). Stratified analyses assessed whether the BMI--liver cancer associations differed by hepatitis sera-positivity in nested analyses for a subset of cases (n = 220) and controls (n = 547). After enrollment, 2,162 incident liver cancer diagnoses were identified. BMI, per 5 kg/m2, was associated with higher risks of liver cancer, more so for men (HR = 1.38; 95\% CI, 1.30--1.46) than women (HR = 1.25; 95\% CI, 1.17--1.35; Pinteraction = 0.02). WC, per 5 cm, was associated with higher risks of liver cancer, approximately equally by sex (overall, HR = 1.08; 95\% CI, 1.04--1.13). Type II diabetes mellitus was associated with higher risk of liver cancer (HR = 2.61; 95\% CI, 2.34--2.91). In stratified analyses, there was a null association between BMI and liver cancer risk for participants who were sera-positive for hepatitis. This study suggests that high BMI, high WC, and type II diabetes mellitus are associated with higher risks of liver cancer and that the association may differ by status of viral hepatitis infection.

  abstract = {Background Residential segregation is an important factor that negatively impacts cancer disparities, yet studies yield mixed results and complicate clear recommendations for policy change and public health intervention. In this study, we examined the relationship between local and Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) measures of Black isolation (segregation) and survival among older non-Hispanic (NH) Black women with breast cancer (BC) in the United States. We hypothesized that the influence of local isolation on mortality varies based on MSA isolation---specifically, that high local isolation may be protective in the context of highly segregated MSAs, as ethnic density may offer opportunities for social support and buffer racialized groups from the harmful influences of racism. Methods Local and MSA measures of isolation were linked by Census Tract (CT) with a SEER-Medicare cohort of 5,231 NH Black women aged 66--90 years with an initial diagnosis of stage I-IV BC in 2007--2013 with follow-up through 2018. Proportional and cause-specific hazards models and estimated marginal means were used to examine the relationship between local and MSA isolation and all-cause and BC-specific mortality, accounting for covariates (age, comorbidities, tumor stage, and hormone receptor status). Findings Of 2,599 NH Black women who died, 40.0\% died from BC. Women experienced increased risk for all-cause mortality when living in either high local (HR~=~1.20; CI~=~1.08--1.33; p~{$<~$}0.001) or high MSA isolation (HR~=~1.40; CI~=~1.17--1.67; p~{$<~$}0.001). A similar trend existed for BC-specific mortality. Pairwise comparisons for all-cause mortality models showed that high local isolation was hazardous in less isolated MSAs but was not significant in more isolated MSAs. Interpretation Both local and MSA isolation are independently associated with poorer overall and BC-specific survival for older NH Black women. However, the impact of local isolation on survival appears to depend on the metropolitan area's level of segregation. Specifically, in highly segregated MSAs, living in an area with high local isolation is not significantly associated with poorer survival. While the reasons for this are not ascertained in this study, it is possible that the protective qualities of ethnic density (e.g., social support and buffering from experiences of racism) may have a greater role in more segregated MSAs, serving as a counterpart to the hazardous qualities of local isolation. More research is needed to fully understand these complex relationships. Funding National Cancer Institute.},

However, most mechanistic models have difficulty estimating the time/region-varying epidemiological parameters, while most deep learning models lack the guidance of epidemiological domain knowledge and interpretability of prediction results. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid model called MepoGNN for multi-step multi-region epidemic forecasting by incorporating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and graph learning mechanisms into Metapopulation SIR model. Our model can not only predict the number of confirmed cases but also explicitly learn the epidemiological parameters and the underlying epidemic propagation graph from heterogeneous data in an end-to-end manner. The multi-source epidemic-related data and mobility data of Japan are collected and processed to form the dataset for experiments. The experimental results demonstrate our model outperforms the existing mechanistic models and deep learning models by a large margin. Furthermore, the analysis on the learned parameters illustrate the high reliability and interpretability of our model and helps better understanding of epidemic spread. In addition, a mobility generation method is presented to address the issue of unavailable mobility data, and the experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of the generated mobility data as an input to our model.},

The government provides goods and services such as registration of births and deaths, public health surveillance of disease and injury, outbreak investigations, research and education, health insurance for the poor and elderly, enforcement of laws and regulations, evaluation of health promotion programs, and assurance of a competent healthy workforce. In the past, economics in public health has almost exclusively focused on efficiency of programs through the use of cost-effectiveness or net present value measures clustered under the rubric of "economic evaluation." Efficiency measures are useful at the programmatic level. However, lack of full employment and market failures including public goods and the impact of consumers and producers actions not reflected in the markets (externalities) not only compromise efficiency but also generate health inequities. We propose an expansion of the scope of existing health economics research in an area characterized as public health economics--the study of the economic role of government in public health, particularly, but not exclusively, in supplying public goods and addressing externalities.},

  abstract = {Background: Coffee is associated with a reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic C hepatitis. This prospective trial was aimed at assessing the mechanisms underlying coffee-related protective effects. Methods: Forty patients with chronic hepatitis C were randomized into two groups: the first consumed 4 cups of coffee/day for 30 days, while the second remained coffee "abstinent". At day 30, the groups were switched over for a second month. Results: At baseline, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were lower in patients drinking 3-5 (Group B) than 0-2 cups/day (Group A) (56\textpm 6 vs 74\textpm 11/60\textpm 3 vs 73\textpm 7U/L p=0.05/p=0.04, respectively).

During coffee intake, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and collagen levels were significantly lower than during abstinence (15\textpm 3 vs 44\textpm 16 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine/105deoxyguanosine, p=0.05 and 56\textpm 9 vs 86\textpm 21ng/mL, p=0.04).

Telomere length and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine were inversely correlated. Conclusion: In chronic hepatitis C coffee consumption induces a reduction in oxidative damage, correlated with increased telomere length and apoptosis, with lower collagen synthesis, factors that probably mediate the protection exerted by coffee with respect to disease progression. \copyright{} 2012 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.},

Methods Longitudinal data collection included self-administered questionnaires and medical data (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) liver enzymes). Two analyses were performed to assess the association between coffee (???3 cups a day) and daily chocolate intake and abnormal values of AST and ALT (AST or ALT {$>$}2.5 ?? upper normal limit (UNL)) (N = 990) over time, after adjustment for known correlates. Logistic regression models based on generalized estimating equations were used to take into account the correlations between repeated measures and estimate adjusted odds ratio. Results After adjustment, patients reporting elevated coffee consumption and daily chocolate intake were less likely to present abnormal ALT (OR = 0.65; p = 0.04 and OR = 0.57; p = 0.04, for coffee and chocolate respectively), while only patients reporting elevated coffee consumption were less likely to have abnormal AST values (p = 0.05). Nevertheless, the combined indicator of coffee and chocolate intake was most significantly associated with approximately 40\% reduced risk of abnormal liver enzymes (p = 0.003 for AST; p = 0.002 for ALT). Conclusions Elevated coffee consumption and daily chocolate intake appear to be associated with reduced levels of liver enzymes in HIV-HCV co-infected patients.

In this paper the authors examine whether or not this is true through an exploratory analysis of the influence that alternative development patterns have on twelve meas- ures of public expenditure: total direct, capital facilities, roadways, other transportation, sewerage, trash collection, housing and community development, police protection, fire protection, parks, education, and libraries. The objectives of the analysis are threefold. First, the authors, through a background discussion, provide a brief overview of previous research on the relationship between urban development patterns and the cost of public services. Second, through empirical analysis, they examine how the character of urban development affects per capita public outlays in a cross-section of 283 metropolitan counties during the 1982 \textasciicircum{} 92 time period. A separate equation is estimated for each measure of expenditure, providing substantive evidence on how density, the spatial extent of urbanized land area, property value, and political fragmentation affect the cost of services. Finally, the authors use the results of the empirical analysis to develop a set of policy recommendations and directions for future research.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several previous studies have documented region or country-specific liver cancer incidence trends around the world. However, no study has systematically examined the international pattern using the most recently updated incidence data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer. METHODS: We examined recent trends in liver cancer incidence rates from 1993 to 2002 by joinpoint analysis for 32 cancer registries worldwide, using Cancer Incidence in Five Continents. We also examined the male to female rate ratios for these and four additional registries, based on the 1998-2002 incidence data. RESULTS: Liver cancer incidence rates for both men and women statistically significantly increased from 1993 to 2002 for 8 of 32 cancer registries considered in the analysis. Increases were largely confined to economically developed countries of Western Europe, North America, and Oceania. In contrast, rates decreased in both men and women in 5 registries including 3 in Asia. Despite this, the incidence rates in Asian countries are twice as high as those in Africa and more than four times as high as rates in North America. Male to female rate ratios varied from 0.9 in sub-Saharan African and South American registries to 5.0 in France and Egypt. CONCLUSIONS: Liver cancer incidence rates continue to increase in some low-risk parts of the world whereas they are decreasing in some of the highest risk countries in Asia. Etiologic studies are required to further elucidate factors contributing to the divergent liver cancer incidence trends worldwide. IMPACT: Our description of international liver cancer incidence trends may stimulate further etiologic studies.},

  abstract = {Spatial clustering has important implications in various fields. In particular, disease clustering is of major public concern in epidemiology. In this article, we propose the use of two distance-based segregation indices to test the significance of disease clustering among subjects whose locations are from a homogeneous or an inhomogeneous population. We derive the asymptotic distributions of the segregation indices and compare them with other distance-based disease clustering tests in terms of empirical size and power by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The null pattern we consider is the random labeling (RL) of cases and controls to the given locations. Along this line, we investigate the sensitivity of the size of these tests to the underlying background pattern (e.g., clustered or homogenous) on which the RL is applied, the level of clustering and number of clusters, or to differences in relative abundances of the classes. We demonstrate that differences in relative abundances have the highest influence on the empirical sizes of the tests. We also propose various non-RL patterns as alternatives to the RL pattern and assess the empirical power performances of the tests under these alternatives. We observe that the empirical size of one of the indices is more robust to the differences in relative abundances, and this index performs comparable with the best performers in literature in terms of power. We illustrate the methods on two real-life examples from epidemiology.},

We identified common molecular subtypes linked to similar prognosis among 199 Thai ICC and HCC patients through systems integration of genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics. While ICC and HCC share recurrently mutated genes, including TP53, ARID1A, and ARID2, mitotic checkpoint anomalies distinguish the C1 subtype with key drivers PLK1 and ECT2, whereas the C2 subtype is linked to obesity, T cell infiltration, and bile acid metabolism. These molecular subtypes are found in 582 Asian, but less so in 265 Caucasian patients. Thus, Asian ICC and HCC, while clinically treated as separate entities, share common molecular subtypes with similar actionable drivers to improve precision therapy. Chaisaingmongkol et al. identify common molecular subtypes linked to similar prognosis in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, clinically different malignancies, among Thai patients.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Asians and Hispanics have the highest incidence rates of liver cancer in the United States, but little is known about how incidence patterns in these largely immigrant populations vary by nativity, acculturation, and socioeconomic status (SES). Such variations can identify high-priority subgroups for prevention and monitoring.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: Incidence rates and rate ratios (IRR) by nativity among 5,400 Hispanics and 5,809 Asians diagnosed with liver cancer in 1988-2004 were calculated in the California Cancer Registry. Neighborhood ethnic enclave status and SES were classified using 2000 U.S. Census data for cases diagnosed in 1998-2002.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Foreign-born Hispanic males had significantly lower liver cancer incidence rates than U.S.-born Hispanic males in 1988-2004 (e.g., IRR = 0.54, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50-0.59 in 1997-2004), whereas foreign-born Hispanic females had significantly higher rates in 1988-1996 (IRR = 1.42, 95\% CI = 1.18-1.71), but not 1997-2004. Foreign-born Asian males and females had up to 5-fold higher rates than the U.S.-born. Among Hispanic females, incidence rates were elevated by 21\% in higher-enclave versus lower-enclave neighborhoods, and by 24\% in lower- versus higher-SES neighborhoods. Among Asian males, incidence rates were elevated by 23\% in higher-enclave neighborhoods and by 21\% in lower-SES neighborhoods. In both racial/ethnic populations, males and females in higher-enclave, lower-SES neighborhoods had higher incidence rates.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Nativity, residential enclave status, and neighborhood SES characterize Hispanics and Asians with significantly unequal incidence rates of liver cancer, implicating behavioral or environmental risk factors and revealing opportunities for prevention.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nIMPACT: Liver cancer control efforts should especially target foreign-born Asians, U.S.-born Hispanic men, and residents of lower-SES ethnic enclaves.},

However, existing data in the US are insufficient: reported vaccination rates are often delayed or not granular enough, and surveys of vaccine hesitancy are limited by high-level questions and self-report biases. Here we show how search engine logs and machine learning can help to fill these gaps, using anonymized Bing data from February to August 2021. First, we develop a vaccine intent classifier that accurately detects when a user is seeking the COVID-19 vaccine on Bing. Our classifier demonstrates strong agreement with CDC vaccination rates, while preceding CDC reporting by 1--2\,weeks, and estimates more granular ZIP-level rates, revealing local heterogeneity in vaccine seeking. To study vaccine hesitancy, we use our classifier to identify two groups, vaccine early adopters and vaccine holdouts. We find that holdouts, compared to early adopters matched on covariates, are 67\% likelier to click on untrusted news sites, and are much more concerned about vaccine requirements, development, and vaccine myths. Even within holdouts, clusters emerge with different concerns and openness to the vaccine. Finally, we explore the temporal dynamics of vaccine concerns and vaccine seeking, and find that key indicators predict when individuals convert from holding out to seeking the vaccine.},

Silicon is an attractive anode material for lithium batteries because it has a low discharge potential and the highest known theoretical charge capacity (4,200 mAh g(-1); ref. 2). Although this is more than ten times higher than existing graphite anodes and much larger than various nitride and oxide materials, silicon anodes have limited applications because silicon's volume changes by 400\% upon insertion and extraction of lithium which results in pulverization and capacity fading. Here, we show that silicon nanowire battery electrodes circumvent these issues as they can accommodate large strain without pulverization, provide good electronic contact and conduction, and display short lithium insertion distances. We achieved the theoretical charge capacity for silicon anodes and maintained a discharge capacity close to 75\% of this maximum, with little fading during cycling.},

Detailed patterns of spread remain elusive, however, due to lack of granular disease data. Here we model high-volume city-level medical claims data and human mobility proxies to explore the drivers of influenza spread in the US during 2002--2010. Although the speed and pathways of spread varied across seasons, seven of eight epidemics likely originated in the Southern US. Each epidemic was associated with 1--5 early long-range transmission events, half of which sparked onward transmission. Gravity model estimates indicate a sharp decay in influenza transmission with the distance between infectious and susceptible cities, consistent with spread dominated by work commutes rather than air traffic. Two early-onset seasons associated with antigenic novelty had particularly localized modes of spread, suggesting that novel strains may spread in a more localized fashion than previously anticipated.},

The immunosuppressive effects of systemic glucocorticoids and increased susceptibility to infections are widely appreciated. However, the dose-dependent model frequently used may not accurately predict the risk of infection in all patients treated with long-term glucocorticoids. In this review, we examine the risks of opportunistic infections (OIs) in patients requiring glucocorticoid therapy by evaluating the influence of the glucocorticoid dose, duration, and potency, combined with biological and host clinical factors and concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. We propose strategies to prevent OIs, which involve screening, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and immunizations. While this review focuses on patients with autoimmune, inflammatory, or neoplastic diseases, the potential risks and preventative strategies are likely applicable to other populations. Clinicians should actively assess the benefit--harm ratios of systemic glucocorticoids and implement preventive efforts to decrease their associated infections complications.},

Data (2000-2009) from the DC Cancer Registry, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS-DC) and Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) were used to estimate CRC incidence in eight DC Wards. Risk factors and CRC screening were analyzed using uni-, bi-, and multivariable statistical methods with survey procedures in SAS (version 9.2) including binary, unconditional multivariable logistic regression analysis. Factors measured included stage of diagnosis, age, gender, race/ethnicity, smoking, alcohol, exercise, body weight, health insurance, education, employment, and income. Over the study time, CRC screening increased from 48.4\% to 68.6\%. Mean age at diagnosis was 67. years. CRC incidence is high in DC. Furthermore, CRC incidence rates in DC below 50. years age were higher than the SEER18 average. Disparities exist between CRC incidence and screening among DC Wards. Identified risk factors for CRC are smoking, obesity, and low physical activity; screening was less prevalent among the uninsured and low socio-economic group. Local variations in CRC occurrence exist and may vary from average national experiences. Identification of local regions which vary from national trends in disease occurrence is important for comprehensive understanding of the disease in the community.},

Multivariate linear probability models are estimated to adjust for demographic and sociodemographic factors.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: The implementation of the ACA (year indicator 2014) is associated with significant reductions in the probabilities of being uninsured (coef=-0.03, P{$<$}0.001), delaying any necessary care (coef=-0.03, P{$<$}0.001), forgoing any necessary care (coef=-0.02, P{$<$}0.001), and a significant increase in the probability of having any physician visits (coef=0.02, P{$<$}0.001), compared with the reference year 2011. Interaction terms between the 2014 year indicator and race/ethnicity demonstrate that uninsured rates decreased more substantially among non-Latino African Americans (African Americans) (coef=-0.04, P{$<$}0.001) and Latinos (coef=-0.03, P{$<$}0.001) compared with non-Latino whites (whites). Latinos were less likely than whites to delay (coef=-0.02, P{$<$}0.001) or forgo (coef=-0.02, P{$<$}0.001) any necessary care and were more likely to have physician visits (coef=0.03, P{$<$}0.005) in 2014. The association between year indicator of 2014 and the probability of having any emergency department visits is not significant.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Health care access and insurance coverage are major factors that contributed to racial and ethnic disparities before the ACA implementation. Our results demonstrate that racial and ethnic disparities in access have been reduced significantly during the initial years of the ACA implementation that expanded access and mandated that individuals obtain health insurance.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

  abstract = {Hierarchical modeling has been used extensively for small area estimation. However, design weights that are required to reflect complex surveys are rarely considered in these models. We develop computationally efficient, Bayesian spatial smoothing models that acknowledge the design weights. Computation is carried out using the integrated nested Laplace approximation, which is fast. An extensive simulation study is presented that considers the effects of non-response and non-random selection of individuals, allowing examination of the impact of ignoring the design weights and the benefits of spatial smoothing. The results show that, when compared with standard approaches, mean squared error can be greatly reduced with the proposed methods. Bias reduction occurs through the inclusion of the design weights, with variance reduction being achieved through hierarchical smoothing. We analyze data from the Washington State 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The models are easily and quickly fitted within the R environment, using existing packages.},

First, we characterize the joint distribution of parent and child income at the national level. The conditional expectation of child income given parent income is linear in percentile ranks. On average, a 10 percentile increase in parent income is associated with a 3.4 percentile increase in a child's income. Second, intergenerational mobility varies substantially across areas within the United States. For example, the probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is 4.4\% in Charlotte but 12.9\% in San Jose. Third, we explore the factors correlated with upward mobility. High mobility areas have (i) less residential segregation, (ii) less income inequality, (iii) better primary schools, (iv) greater social capital, and (v) greater family stability. Although our descriptive analysis does not identify the causal mechanisms that determine upward mobility, the publicly available statistics on intergenerational mobility developed here can facilitate research on such mechanisms.

  abstract = {Background \& Aims Direct-acting antivirals have become widely used for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection with decompensated cirrhosis. Virological responses are excellent and early improvements in liver function, at least in a proportion of patients, have been observed but the longer term impact of viral clearance on end-stage liver disease complications is unclear. Methods Prospective study of patients with decompensated cirrhosis who received 12~weeks of all-oral direct-acting antivirals through the English Expanded Access Programme. Endpoints were deaths, liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma, serious decompensation events, sepsis or hospitalisations, and MELD scores between start of therapy to 15~months post-treatment start. An untreated cohort of patients was retrospectively studied over 6~months for comparison. Results Amongst 317/406 patients who achieved sustained virological response at 24~weeks post-treatment, there were 9 deaths (3\%), 17 new liver cancers (5\%), 39 transplantations (12\%) and 52 with serious decompensations (16\%), over 15~months. When compared to the first six months from treatment start and to untreated patients, there was a reduction in incidence of decompensations [30/406 (7\%) in months 6--15 and 72/406 (18\%) in months 0--6 for treated patients vs. 73/261 (28\%) in untreated patients]. There was no significant difference in liver cancer incidence (10/406 (2.5\%) in months 6--15 and 17/406 (4\%) in months 0--6 for treated patients vs. 11/261 (4\%) in untreated patients). Conclusions This study suggests that antiviral therapy in patients with decompensated cirrhosis led to prolonged improvement in liver function, with no evidence of paradoxical adverse impact nor increase in liver malignancy. Lay summary This is a report of a large group of patients in England who have hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with advanced liver disease. They have been treated with new anti-HCV drugs, which cured the infection in the majority. This study looks at their outcomes a year following treatment, in terms of deaths, cancers and other complications of advanced liver disease. We conclude that in most patients anti-HCV treatment is beneficial even in advanced liver disease.},

Alternative forecasting models are also developed and evaluated based on these factors-using regression analysis (with autoregressive error correction), neural networks, and ARIMA models-to predict transit ridership. It is found that a simple combination of these forecasting methodologies yields greater forecast accuracy than the individual models separately. Finally, a scenario analysis is conducted to assess the impact of transit policies on long-term ridership. \copyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The kinetic relations among protein folding states are very similar to those between enzyme-catalyzed species. Therefore, it should be equally useful to provide a visually intuitive relation between kinetic calculations and folding mechanisms for protein folding kinetics, as manifested by the graphic rules in enzyme kinetics. It can actually be anticipated that, due to increasing interest in protein folding, the graphic method will become an important tool in folding kinetics as well. Based on the recent progress made in graphic methods of enzyme kinetics, in this review four graphic rules are summarized, which can be used to deal with protein folding systems as well as enzyme-catalyzed systems. Rules 1-3 are established for deriving the kinetic equations for steady-state processes and Rule 4 for those in the case of non-steady-state processes. In comparison with conventional graphic methods, which can only be applied to a steady-state system, the current rules have the following advantages: (1) Complicated and tedious calculations can be greatly simplified. (2) A lot of wasted labor can be turned away. (3) Final results can be double-checked by a formula provided in each of the graphic rules. (4) Transient kinetic systems can also be treated. The mathematical proof of Rules 1-4 is given in appendices A-D, respectively.},

The estimated worldwide number of new cases of liver cancer in 2002 is 600,000, of which 82\% are from developing countries. Given the poor survival from this disease, the estimated number of deaths is similar to that of new cases. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the main form of liver cancer. A part from chronic infections with Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C viruses, which are the main causes of HCC, contamination of foodstuff with aflatoxins, a group of mycotoxins produced by the fungi Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, is an important contributor to HCC burden in many low-income country. Alcoholic cirrhosis is an important risk factor for HCC in populations with low prevalence of HBV and HCV infection, and the association between tobacco smoking and HCC is now established. Diabetes is also related to an excess risk of HCC and the increased prevalence of overweight and obesity likely contributes to it. The second most important type of liver cancer is cholangiocarcinoma, whose main known cause is infestation with the liver flukes, Opistorchis viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis, which is frequent in some areas in South-East Asia. Angiosarcoma is a rare form of liver cancer whose occurence is linked to occupational exposure to vinyl chloride.},

A population-based convenience sample of children younger than 18 years and adults in King County, Washington, who enrolled online for home self-collection of upper respiratory samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing were included. EXPOSURES Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription--polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from participant-collected samples. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES RT-PCR--confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with Ct values stratified by age and symptoms. RESULTS Among 555 SARS-CoV-2--positive participants (mean [SD] age, 33.7 [20.1] years; 320 were female [57.7\%]), 47 of 123 children (38.2\%) were asymptomatic compared with 31 of 432 adults (7.2\%). When symptomatic, fewer symptoms were reported in children compared with adults (mean [SD], 1.6 [2.0] vs 4.5 [3.1]). Symptomatic individuals had lower Ct values (which corresponded to higher viral RNA levels) than asymptomatic individuals (adjusted estimate for children, -3.0; 95\% CI, -5.5 to -0.6; P = .02; adjusted estimate for adults, -2.9; 95\% CI, -5.2 to -0.6; P = .01). The difference in mean Ct values was neither statistically significant between symptomatic children and symptomatic adults (adjusted estimate, -0.7; 95\% CI, -2.2 to 0.9; P = .41) nor between asymptomatic children and asymptomatic adults (adjusted estimate, -0.6; 95\% CI, -4.0 to 2.8; P = .74). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this community-based cross-sectional study, SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels, as determined by Ct values, were significantly higher in symptomatic individuals than in asymptomatic individuals and no significant age-related differences were found.

Although the reformulation produced an immediate drop in abuse rates, a definite ceiling effect appeared over time, beyond which no further decrease was seen.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nObjective: To examine the factors that led to the initial steep decline in OxyContin abuse and the substantial levels of residual abuse that have remained relatively stable since 2012.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nDesign, Setting, and Participants: We used data from the ongoing Survey of Key Informants' Patients program, part of the Researched Abuse, Diversion and Addiction-Related Surveillance system that collects and analyzes postmarketing data on misuse and diversion of prescription opioid analgesics and heroin. For our survey study, patients with a DSM-V diagnosis of opioid use disorder and primary drug of abuse consisting of a prescription opioid or heroin (N\,=\,10\,784) at entry to 1 of 150 drug treatment programs in 48 states completed an anonymous structured survey of opioid abuse patterns (surveys completed from January 1, 2009, through June 30, 2014). A subset of these patients (n\,=\,244) was interviewed to add context and expand on the structured survey.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMain Outcomes and Measures: In addition to key demographic measures, past-month abuse of opioids was the primary measure in the structured surveys. In the interviews, the effect of the introduction of the ADF on drug-seeking behavior was examined.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nResults: Reformulated OxyContin was associated with a significant reduction of past-month abuse after its introduction (45.1\% [95\% CI, 41.2\%-49.1\%] in January to June 2009 to 26.0\% [95\% CI, 23.6\%-28.4\%] in July to December 2012; P\,{$<$}\,.001; {$\chi$}2\,=\,230.83), apparently owing to a migration to other opioids, particularly heroin. However, this reduction leveled off, such that 25\% to 30\% of the sample persisted in endorsing past-month abuse from 2012 to 2014 (at study end [January to June 2014], 26.7\% [95\% CI, 23.7\%-29.6\%]). Among the 88 participants who indicated experience using pre-ADF and ADF OxyContin, this residual level of abuse reflects the following 3 phenomena: (1) a transition from nonoral routes of administration to oral use (38 participants [43\%]); (2) successful efforts to defeat the ADF mechanism leading to a continuation of inhaled or injected use (30 participants [34\%]); and (3) exclusive use of the oral route independent of formulation type (20 participants [23\%]).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nConclusions and Relevance: Abuse-deterrent formulations can have the intended purpose of curtailing abuse, but the extent of their effectiveness has clear limits, resulting in a significant level of residual abuse. Consequently, although drug abuse policy should focus on limiting supplies of prescription analgesics for abuse, including ADF technology, efforts to reduce supply alone will not mitigate the opioid abuse problem in this country.},

  abstract = {Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current antiviral therapy fails to clear infection in a substantial proportion of cases. Drug development is focused on nonstructural proteins required for RNA replication. Individuals undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation face rapid, universal reinfection of the graft. Therefore, antiviral strategies targeting the early stages of infection are urgently needed for the prevention of HCV infection. In this study, we identified the polyphenol, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), as an inhibitor of HCV entry. Green tea catechins, such as EGCG and its derivatives, epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin gallate (ECG), and epicatechin (EC), have been previously found to exert antiviral and antioncogenic properties. EGCG had no effect on HCV RNA replication, assembly, or release of progeny virions. However, it potently inhibited Cell-culture-derived HCV (HCVcc) entry into hepatoma cell lines as well as primary human hepatocytes. The effect was independent of the HCV genotype, and both infection of cells by extracellular virions and cell-to-cell spread were blocked. Pretreatment of cells with EGCG before HCV inoculation did not reduce HCV infection, whereas the application of EGCG during inoculation strongly inhibited HCV infectivity. Moreover, treatment with EGCG directly during inoculation strongly inhibited HCV infectivity. Expression levels of all known HCV (co-)receptors were unaltered by EGCG. Finally, we showed that EGCG inhibits viral attachment to the cell, thus disrupting the initial step of HCV cell entry. CONCLUSION: The green tea molecule, EGCG, potently inhibits HCV entry and could be part of an antiviral strategy aimed at the prevention of HCV reinfection after liver transplantation.},

OBJECTIVES: To examine the use of a Spanish surname list to improve the quality of race-related information obtained from rapid case ascertainment (RCA) and to estimate the accuracy of race-related information obtained from cancer registry records collected by routine reporting. SUBJECTS: Self-reported survey responses of 3954 participants from California enrolled in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium. MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and percent agreement. We used logistic regression to identify predictors of underreporting and overreporting of a race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Use of the Spanish surname list increased the sensitivity of RCA for Latino ethnicity from 37\% to 83\%. Sensitivity for cancer registry records collected by routine reporting was {$\geq$}95\% for whites, blacks, and Asians, and specificity was high for all groups (86\%-100\%). However, patterns of misclassification by race/ethnicity were found that could lead to biased cancer statistics for specific race/ethnicities. Discordance between self-reported and registry-reported race/ethnicity was more likely for women, Latinos, and Asians. CONCLUSIONS: Methods to improve race and ethnicity data, such as using Spanish surnames in RCA and instituting data collection guidelines for hospitals, are needed to ensure minorities are accurately represented in clinical and epidemiological research.},

A major question in U.S. segregation research is how the growth of Asian and Hispanic populations is influencing patterns of segre- gation and diversity at the neighborhood level. In this article we use a variant of a nearest neighbor approach to map, graph, and evaluate patterns of race and ethnicity at varying scales.We show that using a multiscalar approach to segregation can provide a detailed and more complete picture of segregation. The research con- firms work from other studies that segregation is decreasing between some groups and increasing between others, and the patterns, and processes can be described as dynamic diversity. In a series of maps of ethnic clus- ters and population homogeneity we show how metropolitan areas, represented in this case by Los Angeles, now display patterns of complex living arrangements with multiple groups inhabiting both local neighborhoods and wider community spheres.},

Activities targeted the individual, community organization, and neighborhood levels and included dissemination of information, presentations at meetings, and provision of street-based and door-to-door vaccination during 2 influenza vaccine seasons. Participants were recruited via multiple modalities. Multivariable analyses were performed to compare interest in receiving vaccination pre- and postintervention.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: There was increased interest in receiving the influenza vaccine postintervention (P{$<$}.01). Being a member of a hard-to-reach population (P=.03), having ever received an influenza vaccine (P{$<$}.01), and being in a priority group for vaccination (P{$<$}.01) were also associated with greater interest in receiving the vaccine.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Targeting underserved neighborhoods through a multilevel community-based participatory research intervention significantly increased interest in influenza vaccination, particularly among hard-to-reach populations.

However, in the pediatric population, skin injury continues to be grouped indiscriminately as various types of pressure ulcers. Objective To identify and describe the phenomenon of skin failure in critically ill children. Methods Retrospective chart review of 19 patients who had serious skin injuries develop. Organ dysfunction scores, medications, pressure ulcer prevention techniques used, and laboratory values in the 7 days leading up to the development of a skin lesion were evaluated. Results At the start of the evaluation period, all patients (N = 19) had pressure ulcer prevention measures in place before the development of a serious skin injury. All of the skin lesions were full-thickness injuries on the day they were identified (as opposed to the more gradual progression from simple to complex skin injuries typically seen in pressure ulcers). As predicted, 18 of 19 patients had multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in the week leading up to the skin injury. All patients with MODS had at least 2 dysfunctional systems, and 12 patients had 4 or more dysfunctional systems. Of the 19 patients, 8 (42\%) progressed to death, compared with 1.8\% in our general pediatric intensive care unit population. Conclusion Although the traditional paradigm is that pressure ulcers are preventable, a subset of pressure ulcers in critically ill children may actually represent acute skin failure as a consequence of MODS.},

Identification of disparities in colorectal cancer screening will allow for targeted interventions to achieve national goals for screening. The objective of this study was to contrast colorectal cancer screening rates in urban and rural populations in the United States. The study design comprised a cross-sectional study in the United States 1998-2005. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data from 1998 to 2005 were the method and data source. The primary outcome was self-report up-to-date colorectal cancer screening (fecal occult blood test in last 12 months, flexible sigmoidoscopy in last 5 years, or colonoscopy in last 10 years). Geographic location (urban vs. rural) was used as independent variable. Multivariate analysis controlled for demographic and health characteristics of respondents. After adjustment for demographic and health characteristics, rural residents had lower colorectal cancer screening rates (48\%; 95\% CI 48, 49\%) as compared with urban residents (54\%, 95\% CI 53, 55\%). Remote rural residents had the lowest screening rates overall (45\%, 95\% CI 43, 46\%). From 1998 to 2005, rates of screening by colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy increased in both urban and rural populations. During the same time, rates of screening by fecal occult blood test decreased in urban populations and increased in rural populations. Persistent disparities in colorectal cancer screening affect rural populations. The types of screening tests used for colorectal cancer screening are different in rural and urban areas. Future research to reduce this disparity should focus on screening methods that are acceptable and feasible in rural areas.},

Despite its importance, the ability to study metabolism at a global scale using genomic technologies is limited. In principle, complete genome sequences describe the range of metabolic reactions that are possible for an organism, but cannot quantitatively describe the behaviour of these reactions. We present a novel method for modeling metabolic states using whole cell measurements of gene expression. Our method, which we call E-Flux (as a combination of flux and expression), extends the technique of Flux Balance Analysis by modeling maximum flux constraints as a function of measured gene expression. In contrast to previous methods for metabolically interpreting gene expression data, E-Flux utilizes a model of the underlying metabolic network to directly predict changes in metabolic flux capacity. We applied E-Flux to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB). Key components of mycobacterial cell walls are mycolic acids which are targets for several first-line TB drugs. We used E-Flux to predict the impact of 75 different drugs, drug combinations, and nutrient conditions on mycolic acid biosynthesis capacity in M. tuberculosis, using a public compendium of over 400 expression arrays. We tested our method using a model of mycolic acid biosynthesis as well as on a genome-scale model of M. tuberculosis metabolism. Our method correctly predicts seven of the eight known fatty acid inhibitors in this compendium and makes accurate predictions regarding the specificity of these compounds for fatty acid biosynthesis. Our method also predicts a number of additional potential modulators of TB mycolic acid biosynthesis. E-Flux thus provides a promising new approach for algorithmically predicting metabolic state from gene expression data.},

Socioeconomic deprivation explained a modest part of this association for black males but not for black females. Our analyses also found that a positive association between social isolation and mortality was more pronounced, for both blacks and whites, in cities that were also high on the index of dissimilarity.

  abstract = {Secondhand tobacco smoke is a recognized health hazard that poses an especially high risk for children. Four U.S. states recently enacted laws prohibiting smoking in cars with child passengers in attempts to reduce this risk. The authors sought to understand the legislative sponsors' perceptions of factors associated with successful enactment of these laws. Items of particular interest included (1) motives for introducing the bill; (2) the development of a policy solution; and (3) the importance of the policy context. To understand these factors, telephone interviews were conducted with the primary sponsor or key staffers of the bills in all four states that have enacted these laws. An open-ended interview guide based on Kingdon's theory of policy making provided an overall structure for interview content. Open and axial coding of the interviews yielded themes around the successful enactment of these laws. We also analyzed the language of the bills, and the timing of introduction and enactment. The research indicates that the relationship between secondhand smoke exposure and children motivated all of the interviewees. Personal experiences were also important. Most interviewees noted little opposition to the bills. According to interviewees, a receptive political climate for smoke-free legislation contributed to the bills' success. Nevertheless, sponsors carefully considered details of the laws and negotiated specific aspects including applicable age, punishment, and enforcement. Kingdon's framework proved an accurate model for understanding policy makers' perceptions of factors associated with the bills' success. Our results will be useful to advocates and policy makers in other U.S. jurisdictions or countries considering similar laws. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

New direct-acting antivirals (DAA) cure HCV infection in over 90\% of patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the early occurrence and recurrence of HCC in cirrhotic patients treated with DAA. Methods We analysed 344 consecutive cirrhotic patients, without HCC, who were treated with DAA, and followed for 24~weeks. Fifty-nine patients had previous HCC. Results DAA therapy induced sustained virological response in 91\% of patients. During 24-week follow-up, HCC was detected in 26 patients (7.6\%, 95\% CI: 4.99--10.84): 17 of 59 patients (28.81\%, 95\% CI: 17.76--42.07) with previous HCC and 9 of 285 patients (3.16\%, 95\% CI: 1.45--5.90) without previous HCC. Child-Pugh Class B, more severe liver fibrosis, lower platelet count, and previous HCC were significantly associated with HCC development, at univariate analysis. At multivariate analysis, Child-Pugh class (p~=~0.03, OR: 4.18, 95\% CI: 1.17--14.8) and history of HCC (p~{$<$}0.0001, OR: 12.0, 95\% CI: 4.02--35.74) resulted independently associated with HCC development. Among the 59 patients with previous HCC, younger age and more severe liver fibrosis were significantly associated with HCC recurrence, both at univariate and at multivariate analysis. Conclusions In patients with HCV-related cirrhosis, DAA-induced resolution of HCV infection does not seem to reduce occurrence of HCC, and patients previously treated for HCC have still a high risk of tumour recurrence, in the short term. For these reasons, all cirrhotic patients should be closely monitored and followed during and after antiviral therapy. Lay summary New direct-acting antivirals are able to eradicate HCV infection in over 90\% of patients with advanced liver disease. Unfortunately, the occurrence of liver cancer is not reduced in effectively treated cirrhotic patients. In addition, patients previously treated for HCC have still a high risk of tumour recurrence in the short term, despite DAA treatment.},

An Eadie-Hofstee (rate of uptake versus rate of uptake over substrate concentration) plot of glucose uptake shows a nonlinear form typical of a multicomponent system. The nature of the constituent components is a subject of debate. It has recently been suggested that this nonlinearity is due to either a single saturable component together with free diffusion of glucose or a single constitutive component with a variable Km, rather than the action of multiple hexose transporters. Genetic data support the existence of a family of differentially regulated glucose transporters, encoded by the HXT genes. In this work, kinetic expressions and nonlinear regression analysis, based on an improved zero trans-influx assay, were used to address the nature of the components of the transport system. The results indicate that neither one component with free diffusion nor a single permease with a variable Km can explain the observed uptake rates. Results of uptake experiments, including the use of putative alternative substrates as inhibitory compounds, support the model derived from genetic analyses of a multicomponent system with at least two components, one a high-affinity carrier and the other a low-affinity carrier. This approach was extended to characterize the activity of the SNF3 protein and identify its role in the depression of high-affinity uptake. The kinetic data support a role of SNF3 as a regulatory protein that may not itself be a transporter.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND AIM: HCV-infected immigrants contribute to the total prevalence in Canada and other developed nations. Little is known about engagement in care, access to service, and treatment outcomes in recipients of Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA) HCV therapies among immigrants living with HCV. MATERIAL AND METHODS: HCV patients assessed at The Ottawa Hospital Viral Hepatitis Clinic between 2000-2016 were identified. Immigration history, race, socioeconomic status, HCV work-up, treatment and outcome data were evaluated. HCV fibrosis assessment, treatment and sustained virologic response (SVR) were compared using logistic regression. RESULTS: 2,335 HCV-infected patients were analyzed with 91\% (2114) having data on immigration (23\% immigrants). A median 16 years (Quartiles: 5, 29) passed from immigration to referral. Access to diagnostic procedures (Fibroscan/liver biopsy) was greater among immigrants compared to Canadian-born (78\% vs. 68\%, p = 0.001) and immigrants had an odds ratio of 1.72 (95\% CI: 1.18-2.51) of receiving a FibroScan compared to Canadians after adjustment for demographic characteristics, HCV risk factors, and socioeconomic status. No differences in SVR were found between immigrants for IFN recipients. Among DAA recipients, rates of SVR were {$>$} 94\% among all patients, 93\% in Canadian-born and 98\% among immigrants (p = 0.14). CONCLUSION: Nearly 80\% of immigrants in this setting had access to fibrosis assessment which was higher than Canadian-born patients. Under half of both groups had initiated HCV therapy. Delays in accessing HCV care represent a missed opportunity to engage, treat and cure HCV patients. HCV screening and health care engagement at the time of immigration would optimize HCV care and therapeutic outcomes.},

METHODS We estimated injection drug use prevalence among Black adults in each MSA by analyzing 3 databases documenting injection drug users' encounters with the health care system. Multiple linear regression methods were used to investigate the relationship of isolation and concentration to the natural logarithm of Black adult injection drug use prevalence, controlling for possible confounders. RESULTS The median injection drug use prevalence was 1983 per 100000 Black adults (interquartile range: 1422 to 2759 per 100000). The median isolation index was 0.48 (range: 0.05 to 0.84): in half the MSAs studied, the average Black resident inhabited a census tract where 48\% or more of the residents were Black. The multiple regression model indicates that an increase of 0.50 in the isolation index was associated with a 23\% increase in injection drug use prevalence among Black adults. Concentration was unrelated to the outcome. CONCLUSIONS Residential isolation is positively related to Black injection drug use prevalence in MSAs. Research into the pathways linking isolation to injection drug use is needed.},

Lack of access to basic resources (food, transportation, and housing) has been consistently associated with suboptimal ART adherence. Moving beyond such direct effects, this study takes a hierarchical resources approach in which the effects of access to basic resources on ART adherence are mediated through interpersonal resources (social support and care services) and personal resources (self-efficacy). Participants were 915 HIV-positive men and women living in Atlanta, GA, recruited from community centers and infectious disease clinics. Participants answered baseline questionnaires, and provided prospective data on ART adherence. Across a series of nested models, a consistent pattern emerged whereby lack of access to basic resources had indirect, negative effects on adherence, mediated through both lack of access to social support and services, and through lower treatment self-efficacy. There was also a significant direct effect of lack of access to transportation on adherence. Lack of access to basic resources negatively impacts ART adherence. Effects for housing instability and food insecurity were fully mediated through social support, access to services, and self-efficacy, highlighting these as important targets for intervention. Targeting service supports could be especially beneficial due to the potential to both promote adherence and to link clients with other services to supplement food, housing, and transportation. Inability to access transportation had a direct negative effect on adherence, suggesting that free or reduced cost transportation could positively impact ART adherence among disadvantaged populations.},

This study aims to identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine uncertainty and refusal among young adults, an underexplored population with regards to vaccine intention generally, in two highincome settings: Canada and France. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from October to December 2020 among young adults ages 18--29 years (n = 6663) living in Canada (51.9\%) and France (48.1\%). Multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the sociodemographic and COVID-19-related measures (e.g., prevention behavior and perspectives, health-related concerns) associated with vaccine uncertainty and refusal. We conducted weighted analyses by age, gender and province/region of residence. Results: Intention to accept vaccination was reported by 84.3\% and 59.7\% of the sample in Canada and France, respectively. Higher levels of vaccine uncertainty and refusal were observed in France compared to Canada (30.1\% versus 11\%, 10.2\% versus 4.7\%). In both countries, we found higher levels of vaccine acceptance among young adults who reported COVID-19 prevention actions. Vaccine uncertainty and refusal were associated with living in a rural area, having lower levels of educational attainment, not looking for information about COVID-19, not wearing a face mask, and reporting a lower level of concern for COVID-190s impact on family. Participants who had been tested for COVID-19 were less likely to intend to refuse a vaccine. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was high among young adults in Canada and France during a time in which vaccines were approved for use. Targeted interventions to build confidence in demographic groups with greater hesitance (e.g., rural and with less personal experience with COVID-19) may further boost acceptance and improve equity as vaccine efforts continue to unfold.},

These measures included bans on large social gatherings; school closures; closures of entertainment venues, gyms, bars, and restaurant dining areas; and shelter-in-place orders. We evaluated the impact of these measures on the growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases across US counties between March 1, 2020, and April 27, 2020. An event study design allowed each policy's impact on COVID-19 case growth to evolve over time. Adoption of government-imposed social distancing measures reduced the daily growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases by 5.4 percentage points after one to five days, 6.8 percentage points after six to ten days, 8.2 percentage points after eleven to fifteen days, and 9.1 percentage points after sixteen to twenty days. Holding the amount of voluntary social distancing constant, these results imply that there would have been ten times greater spread of COVID-19 by April 27 without shelter-in-place orders (ten million cases) and more than thirty-five times greater spread without any of the four measures (thirty-five million cases). Our article illustrates the potential danger of exponential spread in the absence of interventions, providing information relevant to strategies for restarting economic activity.},

Mathematical analysis can be performed to assess the capabilities of these reconstructed networks. The constraints-based framework, with flux balance analysis (FBA), has been used successfully to predict time course of growth and by-product secretion, effects of mutation and knock-outs, and gene expression profiles. However, FBA leads to incorrect predictions in situations where regulatory effects are a dominant influence on the behavior of the organism. Thus, there is a need to include regulatory events within FBA to broaden its scope and predictive capabilities. Here we represent transcriptional regulatory events as time-dependent constraints on the capabilities of a reconstructed metabolic network to further constrain the space of possible network functions. Using a simplified metabolic/regulatory network, growth is simulated under various conditions to illustrate systemic effects such as catabolite repression, the aerobic/anaerobic diauxic shift and amino acid biosynthesis pathway repression. The incorporation of transcriptional regulatory events in FBA enables us to interpret, analyse and predict the effects of transcriptional regulation on cellular metabolism at the systemic level.},

Given documented racial disparities in other parts of the country, longitudinal convergence of COVID-19 rates around race groups warrants assessment. Methods County-level cases for COVID-19 were collected from the Johns Hopkins University, and racial distributions were collected from the American Community Survey. Pearson's correlation coefficients were computed for each day since COVID-19 was first reported in California, and the longitudinal distribution of each race-specific set of correlation coefficients was assessed for stationarity, linear trend and exponential trend. Results Earlier in the outbreak, the distribution of COVID-19 was most highly correlated with Asian American communities; after approximately 100 days, the distribution of COVID-19 most closely resembled that of African American communities. For every day in this dataset, the county-level distribution of COVID-19 was negatively correlated with the distribution of White American communities in California. Discussion The geospatial distribution of COVID-19 in California has increasingly resembled that of African American communities within the state. Further study should be conducted to characterise potentially disproportionate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic across race groups.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fine-scale and longitudinal geospatial analysis of health risks in challenging urban areas is often limited by the lack of other spatial layers even if case data are available. Underlying population counts, residential context, and associated causative factors such as standing water or trash locations are often missing unless collected through logistically difficult, and often expensive, surveys. The lack of spatial context also hinders the interpretation of results and designing intervention strategies structured around analytical insights. This paper offers a ubiquitous spatial data collection approach using a spatial video that can be used to improve analysis and involve participatory collaborations. A case study will be used to illustrate this approach with three health risks mapped at the street scale for a coastal community in Haiti. METHODS: Spatial video was used to collect street and building scale information, including standing water, trash accumulation, presence of dogs, cohort specific population characteristics, and other cultural phenomena. These data were digitized into Google Earth and then coded and analyzed in a GIS using kernel density and spatial filtering approaches. The concentrations of these risks around area schools which are sometimes sources of diarrheal disease infection because of the high concentration of children and variable sanitary practices will show the utility of the method. In addition schools offer potential locations for cholera education interventions. RESULTS: Previously unavailable fine scale health risk data vary in concentration across the town, with some schools being proximate to greater concentrations of the mapped risks. The spatial video is also used to validate coded data and location specific risks within these "hotspots". CONCLUSIONS: Spatial video is a tool that can be used in any environment to improve local area health analysis and intervention. The process is rapid and can be repeated in study sites through time to track spatio-temporal dynamics of the communities. Its simplicity should also be used to encourage local participatory collaborations.},

While the incorporation of geographic information systems as well as concepts such as "neighborhoods" might be viewed as evidence of social epidemiology moving closer to health geography, I argue that the two fields are not well aligned. Health geography has much more to contribute to studies of environment and health, and attention by social epidemiologists to those potential contributions could help rectify this misalignment. This paper suggests a number of geographic perspectives on health and environment that could create useful connections between geography and public health, via social epidemiology. To illustrate this potential, I use an ongoing study of a Texas community exposed to a large petrochemical complex-an inquiry constructed in the mode of social epidemiology-as a case in point. I apply several perspectives and concepts from geography to the case study. Cultural ecology, discourse materialized, political ecology, and territoriality are used to assess the Texas City situation and suggest important types of understandings that can enhance the social epidemiology approach to environment and health. I conclude with a discussion of the prospects for a social epidemiology infused with this type of geographic thought and analysis. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Some studies find that residence in an enclave is beneficial, some reach the opposite conclusion, and still others imply that any relationship is small. One hypothesis is that studies differ because the impact of segregation varies across groups, perhaps because its impact is more benign for better-educated groups. This paper presents new evidence on this hypothesis using data on first-generation immigrants in the United States. We confront the endogenous selection into residential enclaves and find that selection into enclave neighborhoods is on balance negative. Correcting for this selection produces positive mean effects of segregation, and a positive correlation between group average human capital and the impact of segregation. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Of these, 169 (47\%) patients and 335 blood cultures with procalcitonin were included. There were 94 (28\%) positive bacterial blood cultures and 241 (72\%) negative bacterial blood cultures. In bacteremic cultures, the mean procalcitonin level was 9.96 \textpm{} 15.96 ng/mL, and the median procalcitonin level was 4.85 ng/mL (interquartile range 18.5).

  abstract = {The complexity of full-scale metabolic models is a major obstacle for their effective use in computational systems biology. The aim of model reduction is to circumvent this problem by eliminating parts of a model that are unimportant for the properties of interest. The choice of reduction method is influenced both by the type of model complexity and by the objective of the reduction; therefore, no single method is superior in all cases. In this study we present a comparative study of two different methods applied to a 20D model of yeast glycolytic oscillations. Our objective is to obtain biochemically meaningful reduced models, which reproduce the dynamic properties of the 20D model. The first method uses lumping and subsequent constrained parameter optimization. The second method is a novel approach that eliminates variables not essential for the dynamics. The applications of the two methods result in models of eight (lumping), six (elimination) and three (lumping followed by elimination) dimensions. All models have similar dynamic properties and pin-point the same interactions as being crucial for generation of the oscillations. The advantage of the novel method is that it is algorithmic, and does not require input in the form of biochemical knowledge. The lumping approach, however, is better at preserving biochemical properties, as we show through extensive analyses of the models.},

This study focuses on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, grown in aerobic, carbon-limited chemostat cultures. Genome-wide transcript levels and in vivo fluxes were compared for growth on two sugars, glucose and maltose, and for two C2-compounds, ethanol and acetate. In contrast to previous reports on batch cultures, few genes (180 genes) responded to changes of the carbon source by a changed transcript level. Very few transcript levels were changed when glucose as the growth-limiting nutrient was compared with maltose (33 transcripts), or when acetate was compared with ethanol (16 transcripts). Although metabolic flux analysis using a stoichiometric model revealed major changes in the central carbon metabolism, only 117 genes exhibited a significantly different transcript level when sugars and C2-compounds were provided as the growth-limiting nutrient. Despite the extensive knowledge on carbon source regulation in yeast, many of the carbon source-responsive genes encoded proteins with unknown or incompletely characterized biological functions. In silico promoter analysis of carbon source-responsive genes confirmed the involvement of several known transcriptional regulators and suggested the involvement of additional regulators. Transcripts involved in the glyoxylate cycle and gluconeogenesis showed a good correlation with in vivo fluxes. This correlation was, however, not observed for other important pathways, including the pentose-phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and, in particular, glycolysis. These results indicate that in vivo fluxes in the central carbon metabolism of S. cerevisiae grown in steadystate, carbon-limited chemostat cultures are controlled to a large extent via post-transcriptional mechanisms.},

Using data from nonAsian respondents of the Project Implicit ``Asian Implicit Association Test'' from 2007--2020 (n = 339,063), we sought to ascertain if this change in media tone increased bias against Asian Americans. Local polynomial regression and interrupted time-series analyses revealed that Implicit Americanness Bias---or the subconscious belief that European American individuals are more ``American'' than Asian American individuals---declined steadily from 2007 through early 2020 but reversed trend and began to increase on March 8, following the increase in stigmatizing language in conservative media outlets. The trend reversal in bias was more pronounced among conservative individuals. This research provides evidence that the use of stigmatizing language increased subconscious beliefs that Asian Americans are ``perpetual foreigners.'' Given research that perpetual foreigner bias can beget discriminatory behavior and that experiencing discrimination is associated with adverse mental and physical health outcomes, this research sounds an alarm about the effects of stigmatizing media on the health and welfare of Asian Americans.},

We have recently shown that tissue-engineered cardiac graft, constructed from cardiomyocytes seeded within an alginate scaffold, is capable of preventing the deterioration in cardiac function after myocardial infarction in rats. The present article addresses cell seeding within porous alginate scaffolds in an attempt to achieve 3D high-density cardiac constructs with a uniform cell distribution. Due to the hydrophilic nature of the alginate scaffold, its {$>$}90\% porosity and interconnected pore structure, cell seeding onto the scaffold was efficient and short, up to 30 min. Application of a moderate centrifugal force during cell seeding resulted in a uniform cell distribution throughout the alginate scaffolds, consequently enabling the loading of a large number of cells onto the 3D scaffolds. The percent cell yield in the alginate scaffolds ranged between 60-90\%, depending on cell density at seeding; it was 90\% at seeding densities of up to 1 x 10(8) cells/cm(3) scaffold and decreased to 60\% at higher densities. The highly dense cardiac constructs maintained high metabolic activity in culture. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the cells aggregated within the scaffold pores. Some of the aggregates were contracting spontaneously within the matrix pores. Throughout the culture there was no indication of cardiomyocyte proliferation within the scaffolds, nor was it found in 3D cultures of cardiofibroblasts. This may enable the development of cardiac cocultures, without domination of cardiofibroblasts with time.},

  abstract = {Geographic variation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been previously studied in the United States. Using data collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries (SEER) and the 1990 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), we analyzed incidence and risk factors for HCC in nine geographic regions in the United States. We identified all individuals with HCC during 1975-1998 in five states (Connecticut, Iowa, Utah, New Mexico, and Hawaii) and four metropolitan areas (Detroit - Metropolitan, San Francisco-Oakland, Seattle-Puget Sound, and Atlanta - Metropolitan). Age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated for each geographic region. The association between HCC incidence and geographic regions were examined in Poisson multivariate regression model controlling for age, gender, race, and year of diagnosis. Hierarchical linear modeling was also used to examine these associations while adjusting for potential clustering of persons with similar characteristics within geographic regions, and to assess the effect of the prevalence of smoking, alcohol use, obesity, and diabetes in the underlying population in these geographical regions. A total of 11,547 persons with HCC were examined. Hawaii had the highest age-adjusted incidence rate (4.6), followed by San Francisco-Oakland (3.2), New Mexico (2.0), Detroit - Metropolitan (1.9), Seattle-Puget Sound (1.8), Atlanta - Metropolitan (1.7), Connecticut (1.6), Iowa (1.1), and Utah (1.0); all rates per 100,000. Whites had an age-adjusted incidence rate of 1.5, Blacks 3.2, and other races "Asian, American Indian, Pacific Islander" 7.0. However, Blacks and "other races" in Seattle-Puget Sound had higher age-adjusted incidence rates (4.4 and 8.2, respectively) than Blacks and other races in any other registry, while Whites in Hawaii had a higher rate (2.5) than Whites in any other registry. In general, men had a two to three times higher age-adjusted incidence rate than women. However, Hawaiian men had significantly higher age-adjusted rates (7.0) than men in other regions, while Utah had the lowest rates of HCC in men (1.5). Adjusting for variations in ethnicity, gender, age, and time of diagnosis, the Poisson regression analysis showed persistent geographic differences in HCC as well as a change in the order with New Mexico having the highest HCC incidence followed San Francisco-Oakland.

Diverse physiological functions and high metabolic activity of the liver represent significant challenges to engineering implantable devices that provide long-term hepatic support. Liver tissue engineering research has explored alternatives to direct hepatocyte injection that include hepatocyte attachment to microcarriers, encapsulation and transplantation on biodegradable polymer scaffolds. Successful function of hepatocytes transplanted on implantable devices in animal models has been documented by production of albumin and other liver-specific markers, and clearance of bilirubin and urea metabolites. Strategies used to achieve these successes are reviewed, with particular emphasis on biodegradable polymer scaffolds, and two areas of investigation that may improve the function of implantable tissue engineered liver devices are highlighted.},

Despite its popularity, there has been considerable confusion concerning what the concept actually means and how it can or should be applied in feminist inquiry. In this article, I look at the phenomenon of intersectionality's spectacular success within contemporary feminist scholarship, as well as the uncertainties and confusion which it has generated. Drawing upon insights from the sociology of science, I shall show how and why intersectionality could become a feminist success story. I shall argue that, paradoxically, it is precisely the concept's alleged weaknesses -- its ambiguity and open-endedness -- that were the secrets to its success and, more generally, make it a good feminist theory.},

The objective of this research is to assess the extent to which social desirability biases relate to self-reported consumption, hazardous use, and harms. Methods: In each of two studies presented, undergraduate students (N = 391 and N = 177) who reported that they had consumed alcohol in the past year completed online confidential surveys. Results: Both studies show consistent associations between impression management bias and self-reported consumption such that high impression managers report 20 to 33\% less consumption and are about 50\% less likely to report risky drinking. No significant correlations involving consumption were found for self-deception bias. Study 2 also indicated that high impression managers report 30-50\% fewer acute harms following a drinking episode, and that these effects are maintained after controlling statistically for trait impulsivity/constraint. Conclusions: Impression management bias represents a significant threat to the validity of self-reported alcohol use and harms. Such bias may lead to misspecification of models and under-estimates of harmful or hazardous use. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In all cases, DFs showed good adhesion and normal distribution, while in scaffolds with bFGF at 14 days, the cell counts detected in proliferation and viability assays were greatly improved, as was the proliferative state, and there was a decrease in muscle specific actin expression and collagen synthesis in comparison with the scaffolds without bFGF. In addition, the use of plasma without fibrinogen concentration methods, together with the maximum controlled release of bFGF at 14 days, favored cell proliferation. To conclude, we have been able to create an AFS enriched with fully functional DFs and release-controlled bFGF that could be used in multiple applications for tissue engineering.},

However, most phylogenetic approaches, including maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, cannot scale to the size of the datasets from the current pandemic. We present `MAximum Parsimonious Likelihood Estimation' (MAPLE), an approach for likelihood-based phylogenetic analysis of epidemiological genomic datasets at unprecedented scales. MAPLE infers SARS-CoV-2 phylogenies more accurately than existing maximum likelihood approaches while running up to thousands of times faster, and requiring at least 100 times less memory on large datasets. This extends the reach of genomic epidemiology, allowing the continued use of accurate phylogenetic, phylogeographic and phylodynamic analyses on datasets of millions of genomes.},

Early prediction of epidemic outbreaks plays a pivotal role in disease intervention and control. Most existing work has either limited long-term prediction performance or fails to capture spatio-temporal dependencies in data. In this paper, we design a cross-location attention based graph neural network (Cola-GNN) for learning time series embeddings in long-term ILI predictions. We propose a graph message passing framework to combine graph structures (e.g., geolocations) and time-series features (e.g., temporal sequences) in a dynamic propagation process. We compare the proposed method with stateof-the-art statistical approaches and deep learning models. We conducted a set of extensive experiments on real-world epidemicrelated datasets from the United States and Japan. The proposed method demonstrated strong predictive performance and leads to interpretable results for long-term epidemic predictions.},

EXPOSURES This study evaluated UTD status among children reaching specific ages in February, May, and September 2020, compared with those reaching these ages in 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Weekly vaccination rates for routine age-specific vaccines and the proportion of children UTD for all age-specific recommended vaccines. RESULTS Of 1 399 708 children in 2019 and 1 402 227 in 2020, 1 371 718 were female (49.0\%) and 1 429 979 were male (51.0\%); 334 216 Asian individuals (11.9\%), 900 226 were Hispanic individuals (32.1\%), and 201 619 non-Hispanic Black individuals (7.2\%). Compared with the prepandemic period and 2019, the age-limited preventive care period was associated with lower weekly vaccination rates, with ratios of rate ratios of 0.82 (95\% CI, 0.80-0.85) among those younger than 24 months, 0.18 (95\% CI, 0.16-0.20) among those aged 4 to 6 years, 0.16 (95\% CI, 0.14-0.17) among those aged 11 to 13 years, and 0.10 (95\% CI, 0.08-0.13) among those aged 16 to 18 years. Vaccination rates during expanded primary care remained lower for most ages (ratios of rate ratios: {$<$}24 months, 0.96 [95\% CI, 0.93-0.98]; 11-13 years, 0.81 [95\% CI, 0.76-0.86]; 16-18 years, 0.57 [95\% CI, 0.51-0.63]). In September 2020, 74\% (95\% CI, 73\%-76\%) of infants aged 7 months and 57\% (95\% CI, 56\%-58\%) of infants aged 18 months were UTD vs 81\% (95\% CI, 80\%-82\%) and 61\% (95\% CI, 60\%-62\%), respectively, in September 2019. The proportion UTD was lowest in non-Hispanic Black children across most age groups, both during and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (eg, in May 2019, 70\% [95\% CI, 64\%-75\%] of non-Hispanic Black infants aged 7 months were UTD vs 82\% [95\% CI, 81\%-83\%] in all infants aged 7 months combined). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE As of September 2020, childhood vaccination rates and the proportion who were UTD remained lower than 2019 levels. Interventions are needed to promote catch-up vaccination, particularly in populations at risk for underimmunization.},

Although the mechanisms by which chronic hepatitis B viral infection results in hepatocellular carcinoma are unclear, there is good evidence that the virus itself exerts a direct hepatocarcinogenic effect, and this has implications for prevention. First, programs of universal infant vaccination have been shown to be effective in reducing the rate of hepatocellular carcinoma among children. This benefit should be translated into adulthood among vaccine recipients. Second, it has been suggested that antiviral therapy against hepatitis B may reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Antiviral therapy against hepatitis B is effective in causing prolonged lowering of serum levels of hepatitis B virus DNA. There are emerging data showing that prolonged antiviral therapy may reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma among certain patients with chronic hepatitis B.},

Transcription of HXT1-HXT7 was correlated with the extracellular glucose concentration in the cultures. Transcription of GAL2, encoding the galactose transporter, was only detected in galactose-limited cultures. SNF3 and RGT2, two members of the HXT family that encode glucose sensors, were transcribed at low levels. HXT8-HXT17 transcripts were detected at very low levels. A consistent relationship was observed between the expression of individual HXT genes and the glucose transport kinetics determined from zero-trans influx of 14C-glucose during 5 s. This relationship was in broad agreement with the transport kinetics of Hxt1-Hxt7 and Gal2 deduced in previous studies on single-HXT strains. At lower dilution rates the glucose transport capacity estimated from zero-trans influx experiments and the residual glucose concentration exceeded the measured in situ glucose consumption rate. At high dilution rates, however, the estimated glucose transport capacity was too low to account for the in situ glucose consumption rate.},

The present paper discusses the need to include group- or macro-level variables in epidemiologic studies, thus incorporating multiple levels of determination in the study of health outcomes. These types of analyses, which have been called contextual or multi-level analyses, challenge epidemiologists to develop theoretical models of disease causation that extend across levels and explain how group-level and individual-level variables interact in shaping health and disease. They also raise a series of methodological issues, including the need to select the appropriate contextual unit and contextual variables, to correctly specify the individual-level model, and, in some cases, to account for residual correlation between individuals within contexts. Despite its complexities, multilevel analysis holds potential for reemphasizing the role of macro-level variables in shaping health and disease in populations.},

Methods The National Health and Nutrition Examination survey collects nationally representative data on HCV infection in the civilian population of the United States. Data from 2001 to 2010 were combined for this study. HCV testing was completed in 38,025 participants. Results The prevalence of anti-HCV in the United Sates decreased from 1.9\% (95\% CI 1.5\%-2.5\%) in 2001-2002 to 1.3\% (95\% CI 0.9\%-1.8\%) in 2005-2006, and remained stable up to 2010. About 67\% of all infected persons were positive for HCV RNA, indicating 2.3 million people with chronic HCV infection, of whom 68\% have genotype 1. Seventy percent of infected persons were born between 1945 and 1965, with prevalence of 3.5\% (95\% CI 2.2\%-4.8\%). The stable rate since 2006 is mostly related to prevalent cases and foreign born persons migrating into US. Other important risk factors include less education and low economic status. Race, HIV status, number of sexual partners, and blood transfusions are no longer associated with HCV infection. Conclusions As of 2010, approximately 2.3 million persons were chronically infected with Hepatitis C in the US. Most of those infected are prevalent, rather than incident cases. The prevalence of HCV was on the decline, but has stabilized since 2006. Future studies should explore reasons for no decline in HCV prevalence since 2006. ?? 2013 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published.},

  abstract = {Over the last several decades large U.S. cities became increasingly racially diverse. Understanding spatio-temporal dynamics of this significant social change and identifying its broad trends are important for numerous stakeholders. High resolution population grids, which recently become available for the entire conterminous U.S. and for three time points from 1990 to 2010, are an ideal dataset for analyzing dynamics of racial diversity. Their value to diversity analysis has been already demonstrated at the level of the entire U.S. as well as at the level of an individual city. In this paper, we demonstrate their value for performing a survey aimed at synthesizing diversity dynamics from different cities in order to identify prevalent nationwide trends. Our survey consists of 41 large cities. 1990-2000-2010 snapshots of racial condition at each city are provided by respective grids in which each cell is assigned one of nine possible diversity/dominant race categories. All cells with the same diversity label constitute a zone which we refer to as community and measure using a percentage of a landscape (PLAND) and an aggregation index (AI) metrics. An inclusion of the AI metric makes possible to determine not only whether a given community grows or shrinks but also whether it's merging or fragmenting. We analyze the spatio-temporal evolution of communities by tracking changes in the pairs of the values of these metrics. To simplify we categorize these changes into eight categories resulting in 64 possible change trajectories for each community. Trajectories are histogrammed to reveal variety or scarcity of possible modes of change. Frequent trajectories are identified with broad trends. Eight such trends are identified, they represent most prevalent racial dynamics in the U.S. during the decades of 1990--2010. Two trends correspond to decay of whites-dominated and blacks-dominated communities. The remaining six trends correspond to the expansion of Hispanics, Asian, and racially diverse communities. Trends do not show regional dependence, they truly reflect profound social change occurring across the entire U.S.},

We performed a systematic review of epidemiologic studies carried out on HCC aetiology in Southern Europe, an area with an intermediate-high prevalence of these agents as well as of putative risk factors such as tobacco smoking, diabetes and obesity. To retrieve the articles, we performed a Medline search for titles and abstracts of articles. After the Medline search, we reviewed the papers and reference lists to identify additional articles. A synergism between HCV infection and HBV infection, overt (hepatitis B virus antigen (HbsAg) positivity) or occult (HBsAg negativity with presence of HBV DNA in liver or serum), is suggested by the results of some studies. The pattern of the risk for HCC due to alcohol intake shows a continuous dose-effect curve without a definite threshold, although most studies found that HCC risk increased only for alcohol consumption above 40-60 g of ethanol per day. Some evidence supports a positive interaction of alcohol intake probably with HCV infection and possibly with HBV infection. A few studies found that coffee has a protective effect on HCC risk due to various risk factors. Some data also support a role of tobacco smoking, diabetes and obesity as single agents or preferably co-factors in causing HCC. In countries with a relatively high alcohol consumption and intermediate levels of HCV and HBV infections (1-3\% of population infected by each virus), such as Mediterranean countries, the three main risk factors together account for about 85\% of the total HCC cases, leaving little space to other known risk factors, such as haemochromatosis, and to new, still unrecognised, factors as independent causes of HCC.},

Viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, and exposure to hepatotoxins are major risk factors, but nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes, is an increasingly recognized trigger, especially in developed countries. Older age, severity of insulin resistance and diabetes, and iron overload have been reported to predispose to HCC in this context. Remarkably, HCCs have been reported in non-cirrhotic livers in a higher proportion of cases in NAFLD patients than in other etiologies. Inherited factors have also been implicated to explain the different individual susceptibility to develop HCC, and their role seems magnified in fatty liver, where only a minority of affected subjects progresses to cancer. In particular, the common I148M variant of the PNPLA3 gene influencing hepatic lipid metabolism influences HCC risk independently of its effect on the progression of liver fibrosis. Recently, rare loss-of-function mutations in Apolipoprotein B resulting in very low density lipoproteins hepatic retention and in Telomerase reverse transcriptase influencing cellular senescence have also been linked to HCC in NAFLD. Indeed, hepatic stellate cells senescence has been suggested to bridge tissue aging with alterations of the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of obesity-related HCC. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms mediating hepatic carcinogenesis during insulin resistance, and the identification of its genetic determinants will hopefully provide new diagnostic and therapeutic tools.},

Closer attention should be paid to what have proved to be extended processes of economic transformation at the urban scale, the social and geographic contours of which have yet to be adequately mapped.

  abstract = {Sepsis is a complex process defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates in both adults and children, and emphasis has been placed on its early recognition and prompt provision of antimicrobials. Owing to limitations of current diagnostic tests (i.e., poor sensitivity and delayed results), significant research has been conducted to identify sepsis biomarkers. Ideally, a biomarker could reliably and rapidly distinguish bacterial infection from other, noninfectious causes of systemic inflammatory illness. In doing so, a sepsis biomarker could be used for earlier identification of sepsis, risk stratification/prognostication, and/or guidance of antibiotic decision-making. In this minireview, we review one of the most common clinically used sepsis biomarkers, procalcitonin, and its roles in sepsis management in these three areas. We highlight key findings in the adult literature but focus the bulk of this review on pediatric sepsis. The challenges and limitations of procalcitonin measurement in sepsis are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Physical health disparities by sexual orientation are widespread yet under-investigated. Drawing upon theories of biological embedding of social adversity, we tested whether minority stress (in the form of perceived discrimination) is associated with salivary interleukin-6 (IL-6), an inflammatory mediator. Furthermore, we examined whether covering, a strategy involving downplaying a stigmatized social identity, modified this association. A community sample (N~=~99) of gay men (n~=~78) and lesbian women (n~=~21) completed self-report measures of minority stress and identity management and provided saliva samples which were assayed for IL-6. Among gay men, results from generalized linear models supported a hypothesized interaction between perceived discrimination and covering, such that perceived discrimination was predictive of higher levels of IL-6 for those who engaged in less covering but not for those who engaged in more covering. This interaction was robust to a number of potential covariates (alcohol, medication, body mass index, race and age). Results for lesbian women suggested a different pattern: the only statistically significant association detected was between greater perceived discrimination and lower levels of IL-6. Findings from the current study point to an important role for inflammatory processes in understanding and remediating health disparities based upon sexual orientation that stem from exposure to prejudice and discrimination.},

We demonstrate that shape-controlled microgels spontaneously assemble within multiphase reactor systems into predetermined geometric configurations. Furthermore, we characterize the parameters that influence the assembly process, such as external energy input, surface tension, and microgel dimensions. Finally, we show that multicomponent cell-laden constructs could be generated by assembling microgel building blocks and performing a secondary cross-linking reaction. This bottom-up approach for the directed assembly of cell-laden microgels provides a powerful and highly scalable approach to form biomimetic 3D tissue constructs and opens a paradigm for directing the assembly of mesoscale materials.},

Recruitment occurred from March 26, 2018, to January 11, 2023, with follow-up completed on April 12, 2023. Participants were critically ill adults ({$\geq$}18 years) treated with piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem for sepsis.Eligible patients were randomized to receive an equivalent 24-hour dose of a {$\beta$}-lactam antibiotic by either continuous (n\,=\,3498) or intermittent (n\,=\,3533) infusion for a clinician-determined duration of treatment or until ICU discharge, whichever occurred first.The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 90 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes were clinical cure up to 14 days after randomization; new acquisition, colonization, or infection with a multiresistant organism or Clostridioides difficile infection up to 14 days after randomization; ICU mortality; and in-hospital mortality.Among 7202 randomized participants, 7031 (mean [SD] age, 59 [16] years; 2423 women [35\%]) met consent requirements for inclusion in the primary analysis (97.6\%). Within 90 days, 864 of 3474 patients (24.9\%) assigned to receive continuous infusion had died compared with 939 of 3507 (26.8\%) assigned intermittent infusion (absolute difference, -1.9\% [95\% CI, -4.9\% to 1.1\%]; odds ratio, 0.91 [95\% CI, 0.81 to 1.01]; P\,=\,.08). Clinical cure was higher in the continuous vs intermittent infusion group (1930/3467 [55.7\%] and 1744/3491 [50.0\%], respectively; absolute difference, 5.7\% [95\% CI, 2.4\% to 9.1\%]). Other secondary outcomes were not statistically different.The observed difference in 90-day mortality between continuous vs intermittent infusions of {$\beta$}-lactam antibiotics did not meet statistical significance in the primary analysis. However, the confidence interval around the effect estimate includes the possibility of both no important effect and a clinically important benefit in the use of continuous infusions in this group of patients.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03213990},

However, few studies have evaluated variations in the risks of breast cancer-specific mortality across ER/PR status by either demographic or clinical characteristics.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: Using data from 11 population-based cancer registries that participate in the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) program, 155,175 women at least 30 years old with a primary diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma from 1990 to 2001 were included in the study. Associations between joint hormone receptor status and breast cancer mortality risk within categories of diagnosis age, diagnosis year, race/ethnicity, histologic tumor type, stage, grade, size, and axillary lymph node status were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards model.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Compared to ER+/PR+ cases, elevations in risk of mortality were observed across all subcategories of age at diagnosis, ranging from 1.2- to 1.5-fold differences for ER+/PR- cases, 1.5- to 2.1-fold differences for ER-/PR+ cases, and 2.1- to 2.6-fold differences for ER-/PR- cases. Greater differences were observed in analyses stratified by grade; among women with low-grade lesions, ER-/PR- patients had a 2.6-fold (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.7 to 3.9) to 3.1-fold (95\% CI 2.8 to 3.4) increased risk of mortality compared to ER+/PR+ patients, but among women with high-grade lesions, they had a 2.1-fold (95\% CI 1.9 to 2.2) to 2.3-fold (95\% CI 1.8 to 2.8) increased risk.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Compared to women with ER+/PR+ tumors, women with ER+/PR-, ER-/PR+, or ER-/PR- tumors experienced higher risks of mortality, which were largely independent of the various demographic and clinical tumor characteristics assessed in this study. The higher relative mortality risks identified among ER-/PR- patients with small or low-grade tumors raise the question of whether there may be a beneficial role for adjuvant chemotherapy in this population.},

  abstract = {In a 1970 Biometrika paper, W. K. Hastings developed a broad class of Markov chain algorithms for sampling from probability distributions that are difficult to sample from directly. The algorithm draws a candidate value from a proposal distribution and accepts the candidate with a probability that can be computed using only the unnormalized density of the target distribution, allowing one to sample from distributions known only up to a constant of proportionality. The stationary distribution of the corresponding Markov chain is the target distribution one is attempting to sample from. The Hastings algorithm generalizes the Metropolis algorithm to allow a much broader class of proposal distributions instead of just symmetric cases. An important class of applications for the Hastings algorithm corresponds to sampling from Bayesian posterior distributions, which have densities given by a prior density multiplied by a likelihood function and divided by a normalizing constant equal to the marginal likelihood. The marginal likelihood is typically intractable, presenting a fundamental barrier to implementation in Bayesian statistics. This barrier can be overcome by Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms. Amazingly, even after 50 years, the majority of algorithms used in practice today involve the Hastings algorithm. This article provides a brief celebration of the continuing impact of this ingenious algorithm on the 50th anniversary of its publication.},

However, there is controversy about when measles emerged in humans, because the historical descriptions of measles are relatively recent (late ninth century CE). The controversy has persisted in part because ancient RNA is thought to be a poor target for molecular clock techniques. D\"ux               et al.               have overcome the ancient RNA challenge by sequencing a measles virus genome obtained from a museum specimen of the lungs of child who died in 1912 (see the Perspective by Ho and Duch\^ene). The authors used these and other more recent sequencing data in a Bayesian molecular clock--modeling technique, which showed that measles virus diverged from rinderpest virus in the sixth century BCE, indicating an early origin for measles possibly associated with the beginnings of urbanization.

Although it is broadly accepted that this also applies to measles, the exact date of emergence for this disease is controversial. We sequenced the genome of a 1912 measles virus and used selection-aware molecular clock modeling to determine the divergence date of measles virus and rinderpest virus. This divergence date represents the earliest possible date for the establishment of measles in human populations. Our analyses show that the measles virus potentially arose as early as the sixth century BCE, possibly coinciding with the rise of large cities.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION Tumor registries capture valid information at the time of cancer diagnosis, but often do not conduct longitudinal follow-up evaluations. However, investigators may be interested in questions relating to subsequent relapsed disease. Linking administrative data to registry data, as in the creation of the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) and Medicare data set, can provide the ability to infer the occurrence of relapse in selected situations. METHODS The authors created different algorithms to detect relapse of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). A retrospective cohort of patients with AML was identified, and both their billing data and medical records were obtained. The algorithms were then applied to the billing data, the results were compared with medical record review. RESULTS Eighty-nine patients were identified, of whom 22 were treated for relapsed AML. The sensitivity of the best algorithm for detecting relapse was 86\%, and the specificity 99\%, with a positive predictive value of 95\% and a negative predictive value of 96\%. CONCLUSIONS Identification of relapse from SEER-Medicare data using clinical algorithms is feasible for cancers where a majority of patients receive treatment for relapse, without a "watch and wait" strategy, and where that treatment is with a modality that can be detected in billing data (ie, intravenous chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, or all three). Optimal analytic situations are ones in which the investigator is mostly interested in positive predictive value, less interested in sensitivity, and wants to evaluate outcomes among those patients who receive treatment for their relapsed disease. However, the accuracy of such an approach for cancers other than AML has not yet been established.}

However, such patients are not treated simultaneously with antivirals and chemotherapy, owing to overlapping toxicities with previous standard of care treatment of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. AIM To examine the safety and clinically-significant drug-drug interactions observed in patients who received simultaneous treatment with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) and chemotherapy. METHODS Safety was determined by the presence of adverse events which were graded according to the division of AIDS Table (version 2.0). Adverse events were monitored throughout antiviral treatment and up to 3 months after its completion. Drug-drug interactions were assessed using current online databases. Sustained virological response (SVR) was defined as absence of serum HCV RNA 12 weeks after end of DAA treatment. Cirrhosis was diagnosed via imaging, biopsy or with the use of non-invasive fibrosis markers. RESULTS Twenty-one patients received concomitant treatment with DAAs and chemotherapy between January 2013 and September 2016.

The adverse events observed were mainly constitutional (12; 57\%), hematological and gastrointestinal (7; 33\% each). Physicians changed the DAA regimens in two patients (10\%) in anticipation of drug-drug interactions with daclatasvir and dexamethasone. The overall SVR rate was 95\% (20/21). CONCLUSIONS Hepatitis C virus-targeted antiviral therapy can be used concomitantly with selected anti-neoplastic agents under close monitoring for drug-drug interactions. This therapeutic intervention may prevent delay in the administration of chemotherapy in HCV-infected cancer patients.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of acute cold exposure on the timing and amplitude of central aortic wave reflection and central pressure. We hypothesized that cold exposure would result in an early return of reflected pressure waves from the periphery and an increase in central aortic systolic pressure as a result of cold-induced vasoconstriction. Twelve apparently healthy men (age 27.8 +/- 2.0 yr) were studied at random, in either temperate (24 degrees C) or cold (4 degrees C) conditions. Measurements of brachial artery blood pressure and the synthesis of a central aortic pressure waveform (by noninvasive radial artery applanation tonometry and use of a generalized transfer) were conducted at baseline and after 30 min in each condition. Central aortic augmentation index (AI), an index of wave reflection, was calculated from the aortic pressure waveform. Cold induced an increase (P {$<$} 0.05) in AI from 3.4 +/- 1.9 to 19.4 +/- 1.8\%. Cold increased (P {$<$} 0.05) both brachial and central systolic pressure; however, the magnitude of change in central systolic pressure was greater (P {$<$} 0.05) than brachial (13 vs. 2.5\%). These results demonstrate that cold exposure and the resulting peripheral vasoconstriction increase wave reflection and central systolic pressure. Additionally, alterations in central pressure during cold exposure were not evident from measures of brachial blood pressure.},

For each trial identified, logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio for response per 0.01 dollars incentive increase. Odds ratios were pooled in a series of random effect meta-analyses stratified by the minimum and maximum amounts offered. Piecewise logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio for response per \$0.01 increase given in each of five incentive ranges.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nSETTING: Populations in several developed countries, predominantly the USA.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nPARTICIPANTS: 85,671 randomised participants from 88 trials.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMAIN RESULTS: The pooled odds ratios for response per 0.01 dollars incentive decreased monotonically as the maximum amount of incentive offered increased. The piecewise logistic regression model estimated that for incentive amounts up to 0.50 dollars, each additional 0.01 dollars increased the odds of response by about 1\% (pooled OR = 1.012, 95\%CI 1.007 to 1.016). The effects on response above 0.50 dollars were smaller and decreased monotonically in the ranges: 0.50-0.99 dollars, 1-1.99 dollars, 2-4.99 dollars, 5.00 dollars and over, but remained statistically significant up to 5 dollars.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of the best available evidence shows that monetary incentives increase mailed questionnaire response. Researchers should include small amounts of money with mailed questionnaires rather than give no incentive at all.},

To explore methods to optimize the presentation and release of angiogenic factors in such applications in device integration and tissue repair, we studied three variant forms of vascular endothelial growth factor 121 (VEGF121), each with differential susceptibility to local cellular proteolytic activity, formulated within fibrin matrices. (1) The prototypic variant alpha2PI(1-8)-VEGF121 remains immobilized in fibrin matrices until its liberation by cell-associated enzymes, such as plasmin, that degrade the fibrin network [slow, cell-demanded release; J. Control. Release 72 (2001) 101-113]; the alpha2PI(1-8) domain serves as a site for covalent attachment to fibrin during coagulation. (2) We created a new VEGF variant, alpha2PI(1-8)-Pla-VEGF121 that couples to fibrin via a plasmin-sensitive sequence (Pla). Cleavage of this target site by plasmin enables direct release of alpha2PI(1-8)-Pla-VEGF121 from bulk matrix degradation (accelerated, cell-demanded release). (3) Native VEGF121 (burst, passive release) was considered as a reference. VEGF release profiles were determined experimentally as well as mathematically, alpha2PI(1-8)-Pla-VEGF121 being released ca. fourfold more quickly than alpha2PI(1-8)-VEGF121, both being retained compared to native VEGF121; the differences in release could be accounted for based on knowledge of the plasmin sensitivity of the bound growth factor and the structure of the fibrin network. The bound factors were competent in inducing endothelial cell proliferation, the matrix-bound forms being more effective than native VEGF121; as well as competent in inducing endothelial progenitor cell maturation into endothelial cells. These matrix-bound variants of VEGF121 may be particularly useful where retention in locally applied surgical sites is desired, such as prevention of washout from vascular graft coatings and slowing loss from tissue ingrowth matrices used in local tissue revascularization and repair.},

As children are the most frequently bitten subjects, pediatricians should provide parents with everything they need to know in order to confront the problem. However, this does not seem to be case and, as the treatment of bite wounds is frequently inappropriate and delayed, the risk of acute infection and sequelae is increased. The main aim of this review is to discuss the epidemiology, microbiology, and clinical characteristics of infections due to dog and cat bites in children, and suggest the best approach to their management. Analysis of the published literature shows that prompt treatment is necessary in order to reduce the risk of infection. The therapeutic measures include wound washing, specific prophylaxis (i.e., tetanus and/or rabies), and antibiotics in the case of immunocompromised patients or deep wounds (particularly if there is evidence of edema or crushing), facial bites, or any wound over a tendon or bone. \copyright{} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.}

The computed number of ATP molecules produced per pair of electrons donated to the electron transport system (ETS) and energy-maintenance requirements were quantitatively in agreement with experimental results. Computed whole-cell functions of growth and metabolic by-product secretion in aerobic and anaerobic culture were consistent with experimental data, and thus mRNA expression profiles during metabolic shifts were computed. The computed consequences of gene knockouts on growth phenotypes were consistent with experimental observations. Thus, constraint-based analysis of a genome-scale metabolic network for the eukaryotic S. cerevisiae allows for computation of its integrated functions, producing in silico results that were consistent with observed phenotypic functions for approximately 70-80\% of the conditions considered.},

For each cost category, the paper used attributable costs whenever possible. For those categories that attributable cost data were not available, costs were estimated as the product of incremental effect of child maltreatment on a specific outcome multiplied by the estimated cost associated with that outcome. The estimate of the aggregate lifetime cost of child maltreatment in 2008 was obtained by multiplying per-victim lifetime cost estimates by the estimated cases of new child maltreatment in 2008. \textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS\textbackslash nThe estimated average lifetime cost per victim of nonfatal child maltreatment is \$210,012 in 2010 dollars, including \$32,648 in childhood health care costs; \$10,530 in adult medical costs; \$144,360 in productivity losses; \$7,728 in child welfare costs; \$6,747 in criminal justice costs; and \$7,999 in special education costs. The estimated average lifetime cost per death is \$1,272,900, including \$14,100 in medical costs and \$1,258,800 in productivity losses. The total lifetime economic burden resulting from new cases of fatal and nonfatal child maltreatment in the United States in 2008 is approximately \$124 billion. In sensitivity analysis, the total burden is estimated to be as large as \$585 billion. \textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS\textbackslash nCompared with other health problems, the burden of child maltreatment is substantial, indicating the importance of prevention efforts to address the high prevalence of child maltreatment.},

  abstract = {\copyright{} 2018 American Cancer Society. Accumulating data suggest that factors in the social environment may be associated with cancer-related outcomes. Ethnic density, defined as the proportion of racial/ethnic minority individuals residing in a given geographic area, is 1 of the most frequently studied social environment factors, but studies on ethnic density and cancer have yielded inconsistent findings. Thus, the objective of the current review was to summarize the extant data on ethnic density and cancer-related outcomes (cancer risk, stage at diagnosis, and mortality) with the aim of identifying pathways by which ethnic density may contribute to outcomes across populations. In general, the findings indicated an association between ethnic density and increased risk for cancers of infectious origin (eg, liver, cervical) but lower risk for breast and colorectal cancers, particularly among Hispanic and Asian Americans. Hispanic ethnic density was associated with greater odds of late-stage cancer diagnosis, whereas black ethnic density was associated with greater mortality. In addition, this review highlights several methodological and conceptual issues surrounding the measurement of ethnic neighborhoods and their available resources. Clarifying the role of neighborhood ethnic density is critical to developing a greater understanding of the health risks and benefits accompanying these environments and how they may affect racial and ethnic disparities in cancer-related outcomes.},

The method we put forward in this article decomposes the social interaction potential (SIP) metric into interactions within and between social groups, such as people of different race, income level, and occupation. This provides a novel metric of exposure, one of the fundamental spatial dimensions of segregation. In particular, the SIP metric is disaggregated into measures of inter-group and intra-group exposure. While activity spaces have been used to measure exposure in the geographic literature, these approaches do not adequately represent the dynamic nature of the target populations. We make the next step by representing both the source and target population groups by space-time prisms, thus more accurately representing spatial and temporal dynamics and constraints. Additionally, decomposition of the SIP metric means that each of the group-wise components of the SIP metric can be represented at zones of residence, workplace, and specific origin-destination pairs. Consequently, the spatial variation in segregation can be explored and hotspots of segregation and integration potential can be identified. The proposed approach is demonstrated for synthetic cities with different population distributions and daily commute flow characteristics, as well as for a case study of the Detroit-Warren-Livonia MSA.},

To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and patterns of spread within the United States, we sequenced nine viral genomes from early reported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut. Our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genomes with viruses sequenced from Washington state. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated effects of federal travel restrictions. This study provides evidence of widespread sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the United States and highlights the critical need for local surveillance.},

Our target audience is public health researchers, epidemiologists, and biologists seeking a working knowledge of the links between epidemiology, evolutionary models, and resulting epidemiological inference. We discuss the assumptions linking evolutionary models of pathogen population size to epidemiological models of the infected population size. We then describe statistical inference for phylodynamic models and list how output parameters can be rearranged for epidemiological interpretation.

  abstract = {The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase which controls ubiquitination and degradation of multiple cell cycle regulatory proteins. During infection, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a widespread pathogen, not only phosphorylates the APC coactivator Cdh1 via the multifunctional viral kinase pUL97, it also promotes degradation of APC subunits via an unknown mechanism. Using a proteomics approach, we found that a recently identified HCMV protein, pUL21a, interacted with the APC. Importantly, we determined that expression of pUL21a was necessary and sufficient for proteasome-dependent degradation of APC subunits APC4 and APC5. This resulted in APC disruption and required pUL21a binding to the APC. We have identified the proline-arginine amino acid pair at residues 109-110 in pUL21a to be critical for its ability to bind and regulate the APC. A point mutant virus in which proline-arginine were mutated to alanines (PR-AA) grew at wild-type levels. However, a double mutant virus in which the viral ability to regulate the APC was abrogated by both PR-AA point mutation and UL97 deletion was markedly more attenuated compared to the UL97 deletion virus alone. This suggests that these mutations are synthetically lethal, and that HCMV exploits two viral factors to ensure successful disruption of the APC to overcome its restriction on virus infection. This study reveals the HCMV protein pUL21a as a novel APC regulator and uncovers a unique viral mechanism to subvert APC activity.},

Despite national and global initiatives to promote hepatitis B elimination, including newborn vaccina- tion, catch-up vaccination in adolescents and high-risk adults, screening of the blood supply, and treatment of those in need, both new infections and a reservoir of chronic infections con- tinue to result in morbidity and mortality. As with many chronic diseases, racial and ethnic disparities are seen in hep- atitisB virus infection. The goal of this review is to synthesize the data concerning the burden of hepatitis B infection in African Americans and Hispanics, two racial/ethnic groups in the United States who encounter barriers in access to care, low engagement in care, and low utilization of diagnostic and treatment services. Recent Findings Recent data, though sparse in certain areas, continue to suggest differences in rates of incidence and prev- alence of hepatitisBvirus infection in AfricanAmericans, and differences in screening, specialty referral and initiation of therapy for African Americans and Hispanics. Data are lack- ing about differences in liver disease progression and mani- festations in both African Americans and Hispanics. Summary Disparities in hepatitis B diagnosis, disease man- agement, treatment, and prevention remain for African Americans and Hispanics. These disparities require a commit- ment from governmental and public health organizations. The efforts should include increasing vaccination in those most susceptible to infection, screening those at highest risk for infection, initiating antiviral therapy in those who require it, and monitoring for liver-related complications, such as de- compensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the chronically infected. This multipronged approach is necessary to realize hepatitis B elimination.},

  abstract = {\copyright{} 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland. Purpose: Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) incidence and mortality rates are increasing in the United States. New York City (NYC) has a high burden of liver cancer risk factors, including hepatitis C (HCV) and hepatitis B (HBV) infection, which disproportionately affect persons of low socioeconomic position. Identifying neighborhoods with HCC disparities is essential to effectively define targeted cancer control strategies. Methods: New York State Cancer Registry data from 1 January 2001 through 31 December 2012 were matched with NYC HCV and HBV surveillance data. HCC data were aggregated to NYC Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs). Moran's I cluster analysis, Poisson regression, and geographically weighted Poisson regression were used to identify hotspots in HCC incidence and to examine the spatial associations with viral hepatitis rates, poverty, and uninsured status. Results: Among NYC residents, 8,827 HCC cases were diagnosed during 2001--2012. Significant clustering was detected in the HCC rates (Moran's I~=~0.25) with the strongest clustering found in HCC patients with comorbid HCV infection (Moran's I~=~0.47). Poverty and uninsured status were associated (p~{$<~$}0.05) with increased rates of HCC patients with HBV or HCV infection. Neighborhoods with high rates of HCC without viral hepatitis infection had lower rates of poverty and uninsured status. Conclusions: The geographic variation in HCC highlights the need for neighborhood-targeted interventions to address risk factors and barriers to care. The clusters of HCC by viral hepatitis status may serve as a basis for healthcare policymakers and practitioners to prioritize neighborhoods for cancer screening and control efforts.},

  abstract = {Although social stratification persists in the US, differentially influencing the well-being of ethnically defined groups, ethnicity concepts and their implications for health disparities remain under-examined. Ethnicity is a complex social construct that influences personal identity and group social relations. Ethnic identity, ethnic classification systems, the groupings that compose each system and the implications of assignment to one or another ethnic category are place-, time- and context-specific. In the US, racial stratification uniquely shapes expressions of and understandings about ethnicity. Ethnicity is typically invoked via the term, 'race/ethnicity'; however, it is unclear whether this heralds a shift away from racialization or merely extends flawed racial taxonomies to populations whose cultural and phenotypic diversity challenge traditional racial classification. We propose that ethnicity be conceptualized as a two-dimensional, context-specific, social construct with an attributional dimension that describes group characteristics (e.g., culture, nativity) and a relational dimension that indexes a group's location within a social hierarchy (e.g., minority vs. majority status). This new conceptualization extends prior definitions in ways that facilitate research on ethnicization, social stratification and health inequities. While federal ethnic and racial categories are useful for administrative purposes such as monitoring the inclusion of minorities in research, and traditional ethnicity concepts (e.g., culture) are useful for developing culturally appropriate interventions, our relational dimension of ethnicity is useful for studying the relationships between societal factors and health inequities. We offer this new conceptualization of ethnicity and outline next steps for employing socially meaningful measures of ethnicity in empirical research. As ethnicity is both increasingly complex and increasingly central to social life, improving its conceptualization and measurement is crucial for advancing research on ethnic health inequities. \copyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Advantages of interactive health communication include the enhanced convenience, novelty, and appeal of computer-mediated communication; its flexibility and interactivity; and automated processing. We outline some of these fundamental aspects of computer-mediated communication as it applies to preventive medicine. Further, a number of key pathways of information technology evolution are creating new opportunities for the delivery of professional education in preventive medicine and other health domains, as well as for delivering automated, self-instructional health behavior-change programs through the Internet. We briefly describe several of these key evolutionary pathways. We describe some examples from work we have done in Australia. These demonstrate how we have creatively responded to the challenges of these new 'information environments,' and how they may be pursued in the education of preventive medicine and other health care practitioners and in the development and delivery of health behavior-change programs through the Internet.

However, its relationship with therapy for hepatitis C virus infection has not been evaluated. METHODS: Patients (n=885) from the lead-in phase of the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-Term Treatment Against Cirrhosis Trial recorded coffee intake before retreatment with peginterferon alpha-2a (180 mug/wk) and ribavirin (1000-1200 mg/day). We assessed patients for early virologic response (2 log10 reduction in level of hepatitis C virus RNA at week 12; n=466), and undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA at weeks 20 (n=320), 48 (end of treatment, n=284), and 72 (sustained virologic response; n=157). RESULTS: Median log10 drop from baseline to week 20 was 2.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.6-3.9) among nondrinkers and 4.0 (IQR, 2.1-4.7) among patients that drank 3 or more cups/day of coffee (P trend{$<$}.0001). After adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, sex, alcohol, cirrhosis, ratio of aspartate aminotransferase to alanine aminotransferase, the IL28B polymorphism rs12979860, dose reduction of peginterferon, and other covariates, odds ratios for drinking 3 or more cups/day vs nondrinking were 2.0 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-3.6; P trend=.004) for early virologic response, 2.1 (95\% CI: 1.1-3.9; P trend=.005) for week 20 virologic response, 2.4 (95\% CI: 1.3-4.6; P trend=.001) for end of treatment, and 1.8 (95\% CI: 0.8-3.9; P trend=.034) for sustained virologic response. CONCLUSIONS: High-level consumption of coffee (more than 3 cups per day) is an independent predictor of improved virologic response to peginterferon plus ribavirin in patients with hepatitis C.},

We sought to compare the outcomes of patients treated with intravenous (IV)-only vs oral transitional antimicrobial therapy for infective endocarditis (IE) after implementing a new expected practice within the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LAC DHS). Methods. We conducted a multicentered, retrospective cohort study of adults with definite or possible IE treated with IV-only vs oral therapy at the 3 acute care public hospitals in the LAC DHS system between December 2018 and June 2022. The primary outcome was clinical success at 90 days, defined as being alive and without recurrence of bacteremia or treatment-emergent infectious complications. Results. We identified 257 patients with IE treated with IV-only (n = 211) or oral transitional (n = 46) therapy who met study inclusion criteria. Study arms were similar for many demographics; however, the IV cohort was older, had more aortic valve involvement, were hemodialysis patients, and had central venous catheters present. In contrast, the oral cohort had a higher percentage of IE caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. There was no significant difference between the groups in clinical success at 90 days or last follow-up. There was no difference in recurrence of bacteremia or readmission rates. However, patients treated with oral therapy had significantly fewer adverse events. Multivariable regression adjustments did not find significant associations between any selected variables and clinical success across treatment groups. Conclusions. These results demonstrate similar outcomes of real-world use of oral vs IV-only therapy for IE, in accord with prior randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses.},

A number of indices of segregation are examined in this paper and their relative merits in capturing localised societal divisions are discussed. The implications of such divisions on health as mediated through conflict-related stress are then considered. Costed datasets of hospital, community and anxiety/depression prescribing data have been assembled and attributed to local geographies. The association between geographical variations in these costs and levels of segregation was modelled using regression analysis. It was found that the level of segregation does not help to explain variations in costed utilisation of acute and elderly services but does explain variations in the costs of prescribing for anxiety and depression with controls for socio-economic deprivation included. Results in this paper would indicate that strategies to promote good relations in Northern Ireland have positive implications for mental health. \copyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Although the racial disparity in breast cancer mortality is widely discussed there are no studies that analyze this phenomenon at the city level. Methods: We used national death files, abstracting those cases for which the cause was malignant neoplasm of the breast (ICD-10. =. C50) for the numerators and American Community Survey data for the denominators. The 25 largest cities in the US were the units of analysis. Non-Hispanic Black:non-Hispanic White rate ratios (RRs) were calculated, along with their confidence intervals, as measures of the racial disparity. Seven ecological (city-level) variables were examined as possible correlates. Results: Almost all the NHB rates were greater than almost all the NHW rates. All but 3 of the RRs (range 0.78-2.09; median. =. 1.44) were {$>$}1, 13 of them significantly so. None of the RRs. {$<$}. 1 were significant. From among the 7 potential correlates, only median household income (. r=. -0.43, p=. 0.037) and a measure of segregation (. r=. 0.42, r=. 0.039) were significantly related to the RR. Conclusion: This is the first study that we have been able to locate which examines city-level racial disparities in breast cancer mortality. The results are of concern for several cities and for the field in general. A strategy for reducing this disparity in Chicago is in place and may serve as a model for other cities wanting to initiate a similar process. Clearly it is time to take action. ?? 2011.},

We identified and analyzed reported findings on childhood (primarily {$\leq$} 7 years) immunization outcomes from tested intervention strategies that focused on parents, guardians, and caregivers, as well as providers, clinics/practices, and communities. The findings suggest that targeted and tailored interventions offer substantial possibilities, especially in a combined manner.

Moreover, they are sensitive to parents' and providers' needs, are feasibly integrated in daily clinical practice, and account for broader community concerns and issues.},

This study examined the association between the Child Opportunity Index (COI), a multidimensional neighborhood measure of childhood opportunity, and changes in acute care utilization at US pediatric hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the previous 3 years. abstract METHODS: This observational study used administrative data across 41 US-based pediatric hospitals. Children aged 0 to 17 years with emergency department (ED) encounters during the study period were included. The COVID-19 pandemic time period (March 15, 2020--March 14, 2021) was the primary exposure. The primary outcome was the relative volume drop in ED encounters and observation/inpatient admissions through the ED by COI quintile. RESULTS: Of 12 138 750 encounters, 3 705 320 (30.5\%) were among the very low COI quintile. Overall, there was a 46.8\% relative volume reduction in the pandemic period compared with the prepandmic period. This drop in volume occurred disproportionately among the very low COI quintile (51.1\%) compared with the very high COI quintile (42.8\%). The majority of clinical diagnosis groups demonstrated larger relative volume drops among the very low COI quintile. CONCLUSIONS: Acute care utilization decreased the most among children from very low COI neighborhoods, narrowing previously described acute care utilization disparities. Additional study of patient perspectives on health care needs and access during this period is required to understand these changes.},

The overall health of Canadians, as measured by life expectancy or mortality, has improved dramatically over the past 30 years and some disparities have diminished slightly (e.g., life expectancy by income group for men), while others have increased (e.g., diabetes for Aboriginal peoples). Arguably the most egregious health disparities in Canada are those existing between Aboriginals and the rest of the Canadian population. This paper focuses specifically on three social determinants and their effects on disparities in health; Aboriginal status, income, and place. Overall we take the approach that disparities in health could be alleviated by reducing inequities in the distribution of these determinants. We further argue that these social determinants are proxies for opportunities, resources and constraints; all of which influence health outcomes. We suggest that policies focus on reducing the social inequities that lead to health disparities in Canada, rather than focusing on the disparities in health alone. Since the social determinants described here have been found to influence an array of disease outcomes, tackling them, rather than their outcomes, may have a greater overall influence on the health of the population. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Methods Using data from the California Cancer Registry, information on all primary invasive cervical cancer (Cca) patients diagnosed in California from January 1, 1990 through December 31, 2004 was obtained. We analyzed the influence of enclave, socioeconomic status and nativity on Cca incidence. Results Among the 22,189 Cca cases diagnosed between 1990 and 2004, 50\% were non-Hispanic white, 39\% Hispanic and 11\% Asian women, and 63\% US-born. Seventy percent of the Cca cases were squamous cell carcinoma, 19\% adenocarcinoma and 11\% other histologies. Higher incidence of Cca was observed in high enclave (76\%) and low socioeconomic status (70\%) neighborhoods. By ethnic group, US-born women showed lower rates of squamous cell carcinoma compared to foreign-born women. Hispanics living in low socioeconomic and high enclave had 12.7 times higher rate of Cca than those living in high socioeconomic, low enclave neighborhoods. For Asian women incidence rates were 6 times higher in the low socioeconomic, high enclave neighborhoods compared to those living in high socioeconomic, low enclave neighborhoods. Conclusion More targeted outreach to increase Pap smear screening and human papilloma virus vaccination for women living in high enclave neighborhoods can help decrease the incidence of Cca in these groups of women.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We examined the relationship between spatial accessibility to pediatric immunization providers and vaccination compliance in a low-income, urban population of children. METHODS: In 2007, we accessed the Washington, DC, Immunization Information System (IIS) to collect data on the immunization statuses and residential addresses of children who were aged 19 to 35 months and had Medicaid insurance. In addition, we calculated each child's spatial accessibility to pediatric vaccination providers by assessing the provider-to-population ratio at each residential address. Spatial accessibility was divided into tertiles (low, medium, and high) of access. The relationship between spatial accessibility to providers and vaccination compliance was examined by using logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, type of vaccination provider, and enrollment in child care status. RESULTS: Overall for our cohort of 4195 children, 80.5\% of the children were up-to-date with vaccinations. Vaccination coverage ranged from 61.6\% to 100\% (median: 79.2\%) among different neighborhoods. Having the highest level of access to pediatric vaccination providers was associated with 36\% higher odds of being up-to-date as compared with having the lowest level of access. The middle tertile of access was associated with 25\% higher odds of being up-to-date. CONCLUSIONS: Within our low-income, urban population, children with higher spatial accessibility to pediatric vaccination providers were more likely to be up-to-date with vaccinations. This association may guide future studies and efforts to ensure adequate immunization coverage for children regardless of where they live. Pediatrics 2009; 124:1579--1586},

The results indicated no significant excess risk for chewers, smokers and alcohol drinkers compared to those without the habits. However some significant findings emerged regarding the dietary habits. Cabbage-eaters had a 50\% reduction in risk among both the sexes, compared to those who did not eat cabbage. Sprout eaters also had an 30-50\% reduction in risk. There was an enhanced 1.6-fold risk among men who ate 'dry-fish' compared to those who did not eat dry-fish (OR=1.6; CI: 1.0, 2.6). Among women, meat-eaters had a 2.4-fold excess risk than non-meat-eaters. Likewise for fresh-fish eaters, there was a 40-70\% reduction in risk compared to those who did not eat fresh-fish. Dark-green-leafy-vegetables and 'other vegetables' did not show any protective effect for colorectal cancer in this study.},

  abstract = {Chicago's 1933 world's fair set a new direction for international expositions. Earlier fairs had exhibited technological advances, but Chicago's fair organizers used the very idea of progress to buoy national optimism during the Depression's darkest years. Orchestrated by business leaders and engineers, almost all former military men, the fair reflected a business-military-engineering model that envisioned a promising future through science and technology's application to everyday life. But not everyone at Chicago's 1933 exposition had abandoned notions of progress that entailed social justice and equality, recognition of ethnicity and gender, and personal freedom and expression. The fair's motto, "Science Finds, Industry Applies, Man Conforms," was challenged by iconoclasts such as Sally Rand, whose provocative fan dance became a persistent symbol of the fair, as well as a handful of others, including African Americans, ethnic populations and foreign nationals, groups of working women, and even well-heeled socialites. Cheryl R. Ganz offers the stories of fair planners and participants who showcased education, industry, and entertainment to sell optimism during the depths of the Great Depression. This engaging history also features eighty-six photographs--nearly half of which are full color--of key locations, exhibits, and people, as well as authentic ticket stubs, postcards, pamphlets, posters, and other items.},

These inequities might be explained by racism, given the fact that racism has restricted the lives of racial minorities and immigrants throughout history. Recent studies have documented that individuals who report experiencing racism have greater rates of illnesses. While this body of research has been invaluable in advancing knowledge on health inequities, it still locates the experiences of racism at the individual level. Yet, the health of social groups is likely most strongly affected by structural, rather than individual, phenomena. The structural forms of racism and their relationship to health inequities remain under-studied. This article reviews several ways of conceptualizing structural racism, with a focus on social segregation, immigration policy, and intergenerational effects. Studies of disparities should more seriously consider the multiple dimensions of structural racism as fundamental causes of health disparities.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of coffee in HCC, taking the main risk factors into account. METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted in an area of northern Italy. We recruited 250 HCC cases and 500 controls hospitalized for any reasons other than neoplasms, and liver and alcohol-related diseases. Subjects were interviewed on their lifetime history of coffee consumption using a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: Coffee consumption in the decade before the interview was associated with a decreasing risk of HCC with a clear dose-effect relation. With respect to non-drinking subjects, the odds ratios (ORs) were: 0.8, (95\% CI 0.4-1.3) for 1-2 cups/day, 0.4 (95\% CI 0.2-0.8) for 3-4 cups/day and 0.3 (95\% CI 0.1-0.7) for 5 or more cups/day. The ORs for HCC decreased for drinking {$>$}2, compared to 0-2 cups/day of coffee, for an alcohol intake {$>$}80 g/day (OR from 5.7 to 3.3), for presence of hepatitis B virus infection (OR from 16.4 to 7.3) or hepatitis C virus infection (OR from 38.2 to 9.0).

  abstract = {The current study examines what factors contribute to higher injury risk among Aboriginal peoples, compared to the total British Columbia (BC) population. We explore socioeconomic, geographic, and cultural factors, and combinations of these factors, that contribute to increased injury risk for Aboriginal peoples. This follows from our previously reported findings of improvements in injury risk over time for both the total and Aboriginal populations. We use provincial population-based linked health care databases of hospital discharge records. We identify three population groups: total BC population, and Aboriginal populations living off-reserve, or on-reserve. For each group we calculate age and gender-standardized relative risks (SRR) of injury-related hospitalization, relative to the total population of BC, for two 5-year time periods (1999--2003, and 2004--2008). We use custom data from the 2001 and 2006 long-form Censuses that described income, education, employment, housing conditions, proportion of urban dwellers, proportion of rural dwellers, and prevalence of Aboriginal ethnicity. We use multivariable linear regression to examine the associations between the census characteristics and SRR of injury. The best-fitting model was an excellent fit (R2~=~0.905, p~{$<~$}0.001) among the three population groups within Health Service Delivery Areas of BC. We find indicators in all three categories (socioeconomic, geographic, and cultural) are associated with disparity in injury risk. While the socioeconomic indicators (income, education, housing, employment) were shown to be highly correlated, only living in housing that needs major repair and occupational hazardousness, along with rural residence and Aboriginal ethnicity, remained in the final model. Our data show that cultural density is not associated with injury risk for Aboriginal peoples, and that living off-reserve is associated with reduced injury by improving socioeconomic and geographic conditions (compared to living on-reserve). Finally, our analyses show that Aboriginal status itself is associated with injury risk. Our findings confirm previous research indicating that geographical differences differentiate injury risk, including for Aboriginal populations, and that socioeconomic determinants are associated with health risks. Our analyses showing that Aboriginal status itself contributes to injury risk is new, but we can only speculate about pathway, and whether the causes are direct or indirect.},

  abstract = {The eukaryotic cell cycle is characterized by alternating oscillations in the activities of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) and the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). Successful completion of the cell cycle is dependent on the precise, temporally ordered appearance of these activities. A modest level of Cdk activity is sufficient to initiate DNA replication, but mitosis and APC activation require an elevated Cdk activity. In present-day eukaryotes, this temporal order is provided by a complex network of regulatory proteins that control both Cdk and APC activities via sharp thresholds, bistability, and time delays. Using simple computational models, we show here that these dynamical features of cell-cycle organization could emerge in a control system driven by a single Cdk/cyclin complex and APC wired in a negative-feedback loop. We show that ordered phosphorylation of cellular proteins could be explained by multisite phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and competition of substrates for interconverting kinase (Cdk) and phosphatase. In addition, the competition of APC substrates for ubiquitylation can create and maintain sustained oscillations in cyclin levels. We propose a sequence of models that gets closer and closer to a realistic model of cell-cycle control in yeast. Since these models lack the elaborate control mechanisms characteristic of modern eukaryotes, they suggest that bistability and time delay may have characterized eukaryotic cell divisions before the current cell-cycle control network evolved in all its complexity.},

Previous studies of such concordance are outdated. Objective: To characterize the accuracy of cancer mortality statistics from the concordance between cancer cause of death and primary cancer site at diagnosis. Design: Central cancer registry records from California, Colorado, and Idaho in the U.S. were linked with state vital statistics data and evaluated by demographic and tumor information across 79 site categories. A retrospective arm (confirmation rate per 100 deaths) compared death certificate data from 2002 to 2004 with cancer registry diagnoses from 1993 to 2004, while a prospective arm (detection rate per 100 deaths) compared cancer registry diagnoses from 1993 to 1995 with death certificate data from 1993 to 2004 by International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) version used to code deaths. Results: With n=265,863 deaths where cancer was recorded as the underlying cause based on the death certificate, the overall confirmation rate for ICD-10 was 82.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 82.6--83.0\%), the overall detection rate for ICD-10 was 81.0\% (95\% CI, 80.4--81.6\%), and the overall detection rate for ICD-9 was 85.0\% (95\% CI, 84.8--85.2\%). These rates varied across primary sites, where some rates were {$<$}50\%, some were 95\% or greater, and notable differences between confirmation and detection rates were observed. Conclusions: Important unique information on the quality of cancer mortality data obtained from death certificates is provided. In addition, information is provided for future studies of the concordance of primary cancer site between population-based cancer registry data and data from death certificates, particularly underlying causes of death coded in ICD-10.}

A comparison is made between a general G statistic and Moran's I for similar hypothetical and empirical conditions. The empirical work includes studies of sudden infant death syndrome by county in North Carolina and dwelling unit prices in metropolitan San Diego by zip-code districts. Results indicate that G statistics should be used in conjunction with I in order to identijiy characteristics of patterns not revealed by the I statistic alone and, specijically, the Gi and GT statistics enable us to detect local ``pockets'' of dependence that may not show up when using global statistics.}

More or less, with some fluctuations, numbers of reported cases in the past few years have shown a rising trend. Year 2014 pushed the country into the deep sea of difficulties, as number of cases rose to red alert level of 328. Security situation has adversely affected the whole immunization coverage campaign. In a country where 40 polio vaccinators have been killed since 2012, such a big number of cases is not a surprising outcome. Worse perception of parents about polio vaccine as in Karachi and FATA, the high risk zones, makes 100\% coverage a dream. Minor and perhaps delayed payments to polio workers make them frustrated, resulting in decline of trained manpower for vaccination. Strong implementation of policies is required and those found guilty of attack on polio workers need to be punished. Targeted community awareness programme, strong surveillance network, and involvement of influential religious entities can help to root out polio disease from country. Present review is aimed at analyzing all barriers on the road to success in eradication of polio from Pakistan.},

  abstract = {Background Historically, lack of data on cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination has been identified as a barrier to vaccine use in low- and middle-income countries. We conducted a systematic review of economic evaluations describing (1) costs of influenza illness; (2) costs of influenza vaccination programs; and (3) vaccination cost-effectiveness from low- and middle-income countries to assess if gaps persist that could hinder global implementation of influenza vaccination programs. Methods and findings We performed a systematic search in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Scopus in January 2022 and October 2023 using a combination of the following key words: ``influenza'' AND ``cost'' OR ``economic.'' The search included studies with publication years 2012 through 2022. Studies were eligible if they (1) presented original, peer-reviewed findings on cost of illness, cost of vaccination program, or cost-effectiveness of vaccination for seasonal influenza; and (2) included data for at least 1 low- or middle-income country. We abstracted general study characteristics and data specific to each of the 3 study types. Of 54 included studies, 26 presented data on cost-effectiveness, 24 on cost-of-illness, and 5 on program costs. Represented countries were classified as upper-middle income (UMIC; n = 12), lower-middle income (LMIC; n = 7), and low-income (LIC; n = 3). The most evaluated target groups were children (n = 26 studies), older adults (n = 17), and persons with chronic medical conditions (n = 12); fewer studies evaluated pregnant persons (n = 9), healthcare workers (n = 5), and persons in congregate living settings (n = 1). Costs-of-illness were generally higher in UMICs than in LMICs/LICs; however, the highest national economic burden, as a percent of gross domestic product and national health expenditure, was reported from an LIC. Among studies that evaluated the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccine introduction, most (88\%) interpreted at least 1 scenario per target group as either cost-effective or cost-saving, based on thresholds designated in the study. Key limitations of this work included (1) heterogeneity across included studies; (2) restrictiveness of the inclusion criteria used; and (3) potential for missed influenza burden from use of sentinel surveillance systems. Conclusions The 54 studies identified in this review suggest an increased momentum to generate economic evidence about influenza illness and vaccination from low- and middle-income countries during 2012 to 2022. However, given that we observed substantial heterogeneity, continued evaluation of the economic burden of influenza illness and costs/cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination, particularly in LICs and among underrepresented target groups (e.g., healthcare workers and pregnant persons), is needed. Use of standardized methodology could facilitate pooling across settings and knowledge sharing to strengthen global influenza vaccination programs.},

  abstract = {Bayesian methods have been used quite extensively in recent years for solving small-area estimation problems. Particularly effective in this regard has been the hierarchical or empirical Bayes approach, which is especially suitable for a systematic connection of local areas through models. However, the development to date has mainly concentrated on continuous-valued variates. Often the survey data are discrete or categorical, so that hierarchical or empirical Bayes techniques designed for continuous variates are inappropriate. This article considers hierarchical Bayes generalized linear models for a unified analysis of both discrete and continuous data. A general theorem is provided that ensures the propriety of posteriors under diffuse priors. This result is then extended to the case of spatial generalized linear models. The hierarchical Bayes procedure is implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo integration techniques. Two examples (one featuring spatial correlation structure) are given to illustrate the general method. CR - Copyright \copyright{} 1998 American Statistical Association},

Among the children, the relation was mediated by distress as well as their risk cognitions (favorability of their risk images and their willingness to use) and the extent to which they reported affiliating with friends who were using substances. Each of these relations with discrimination was positive. In contrast, effective parenting was associated with less willingness and intention to use. Theoretical and applied implications of the results are discussed.},

Some argue that racial segregation is related to poor health outcomes, whereas others suspect that racial segregation may actually lead to improved health for some minority communities. Even less is known about whether minority access to white neighborhoods improves health. We address these gaps with individual data from the 2010 Public Health Management Corporation's Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health Survey and census tract data from the 2010 Decennial Census and the 2006-2010 American Community Survey. We implement logistic multilevel models to determine whether and how a resident's self-rated health is affected by the racial/ethnic segregation of their neighborhoods. Our key finding suggests that the effects of segregation on self-rated health depend on an individual's race/ethnicity, with blacks and Latino residents most likely to experience adverse effects. Particularly, minorities living in predominantly white communities have a significantly higher likelihood to report poor/fair health than they would in segregated minority neighborhoods. These findings make clear that access to white neighborhoods is not sufficient to improve minority health; fuller neighborhood integration is necessary to ensure all have health equity.},

METHODS In a retrospective cohort study, we linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results tumor registry data with Medicare claims data. The cohort included 11225 Medicare patients who had undergone surgery for early-stage breast cancer from 1994 to 1996 in 457 different hospitals. Primary outcomes were all-cause and breast cancer-specific survival rates at a mean follow-up time of 62.5 months. RESULTS In comparison with treatment in a low-volume hospital, treatment in a high-volume hospital was associated with hazard ratios of 0.83 (95\% confidence interval [CI]=0.75, 0.92) for all-cause mortality and 0.80 (CI=0.66, 0.97) for breast cancer-specific mortality. CONCLUSIONS An association between the volume of breast cancer operations performed in a hospital and 5-year survival rates was observed for both all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality. Further work investigating the aspects of hospital volume that contribute to increased survival is warranted.}

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Care adherent to the 1990 National Institutes of Health consensus statement recommendations. RESULTS Surgeon age and specialty were not associated with adherent care overall, nor among breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy subgroups. Patients of higher-volume surgeons were significantly more likely to undergo adherent care overall because of greater use of lymph node dissection among women who received either breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy. Patients of female surgeons and surgeons with a medical school affiliation were less likely to undergo adherent care overall, which was related to greater use of breast-conserving surgery and lesser use of lymph node dissection among patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery. CONCLUSIONS Several surgeon characteristics are significantly associated with variations in breast cancer treatment received. These results warrant further investigation into the association between these surgeon characteristics and cancer care outcomes.}

Patients with various degrees of severity of knee or hip OA answered the questionnaire. For each domain, their responses to the items were analysed with a Rasch family model, the partial credit model. We examined the fit of data to model expectations, as well as assumptions of unidimensionality and local independence. Invariance was assessed by analysis of differential item functioning (DIF) by sex, age and joint. Analyses used the RUMM2020 software (Rumm Laboratory, Perth, Western Australia). Results. Responses for 544 patients were analysed: 297 had medically managed OA and 247 were waiting for arthroplasty surgery. For the 40 items of the OAKHQOL, data analysis showed 5 with disordered thresholds and 9 with DIF (5 for joint, 3 for sex and 1 for age). Ten pairs of items showed local dependence and four domains showed unidimensionality. Full-item domains and domains without the misfitted items did not differ in patient-estimates data; therefore any bias at the item level is negligible when considering the domain scores. Conclusion. The five domains of the OAKHQOL questionnaire show good measurement properties by Rasch analysis and provide valid scales.},

Purpose: To compare FQHC and look-alike physician performance with private practice primary care physicians (PCPs) on ambulatory care quality measures. Methods: The study was a cross-sectional analysis of visits in the 2006-2008 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Performance of FQHCs and look-alikes on 18 quality measures was compared with private practice PCPs. Data analysis was completed in 2011. Results: Compared to private practice PCPs, FQHCs and look-alikes performed better on six measures (p{$<$}0.05); worse on diet counseling in at-risk adolescents (26\% vs 36\%, p=0.05); and no differently on 11 measures. Higher performance occurred in ACE inhibitors use for congestive heart failure (51\% vs 37\%, p=0.004); aspirin use in coronary artery disease (CAD; 57\% vs 44\%, p=0.004); ??-blocker use for CAD (59\% vs 47\%, p=0.01); no use of benzodiazepines in depression (91\% vs 84\%, p=0.008); blood pressure screening (90\% vs 86\%, p{$<$}0.001); and screening electrocardiogram (EKG) avoidance in low-risk patients (99\% vs 93\%, p{$<$}0.001). Adjusting for patient characteristics yielded similar results, except that private practice PCPs no longer performed better on any measures. Conclusions: FQHCs and look-alikes demonstrated equal or better performance than private practice PCPs on select quality measures despite serving patients who have more chronic disease and socioeconomic complexity. These findings can provide policymakers with some reassurance as to the quality of chronic disease and preventive care at Federally Qualified Health Centers and look-alikes, as they plan to use these health centers to serve 20 million newly insured individuals. ?? 2012 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

We performed content analysis of proposed bills in state legislatures from 2011 to 2017. We classified bills as provaccination or antivaccination. Results. State legislators proposed 175 bills, with the volume increasing over time: 92 (53\%) bills expanded access to exemptions, and 83 (47\%) limited the ability to exempt. Of the 13 bills signed into law, 12 (92\%) limited the ability to exempt. Bills that expanded access to exemptions were more likely to come from Republican legislators and Northeastern and Southern states. Conclusions. Although most proposed legislation would have expanded access to exemptions, bills that limited exemptions were more likely to be enacted into law. Legal barriers to exempt one's children from vaccination persist despite vaccine hesitancy, which is encouraging for public health. Public Health Implications. Most vaccine exemption laws introduced in state legislatures would pose threats to the public's health. There is a need for constituents to engage their elected legislators and advocate provaccination policies.},

We developed the California Neighborhoods Data System (CNDS), an integrated system of small area-level measures of socioeconomic and built environments for California, which can be readily linked to individual-level geocoded records. The CNDS includes measures such as socioeconomic status, population density, racial residential segregation, ethnic enclaves, distance to hospitals, walkable destinations, and street connectivity. Linking the CNDS to geocoded cancer patient information from the California Cancer Registry, we demonstrate the variability of CNDS measures by neighborhood socioeconomic status and predominant race/ethnicity for the 7,049 California census tracts, as well as by patient race/ethnicity. The CNDS represents an efficient and cost-effective resource for cancer epidemiology and control. It expands our ability to understand the role of neighborhoods with regard to cancer incidence and outcomes. Used in conjunction with cancer registry data, these additional contextual measures enable the type of transdisciplinary, "cells-to-society" research that is now being recognized as necessary for addressing population disparities in cancer incidence and outcomes.},

METHODS: EPIC is a multicentre prospective study carried out in 23 centres in 10 European countries: Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom, including 519,978 participants (366,521 women and 153,457 men), most aged 35-70 years. RESULTS: We observed the following significant associations: gastric cancer risk was inversely associated with high plasma vitamin C, some carotenoids, retinol and {$\alpha$}-tocopherol, high intake of cereal fibre and high adhesion to Mediterranean diet, while red and processed meat were associated with increased risk. High intake of dietary fibre, fish, calcium, and plasma vitamin D were associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer, while red and processed meat intake, alcohol intake, body mass index (BMI) and abdominal obesity were associated with an increased risk. High intake of fruit and vegetables in current smokers were associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer. An increased risk of breast cancer was associated with high saturated fat intake and alcohol intake. In postmenopausal women, BMI was positively and physical activity negatively associated with breast cancer risk. High intake of dairy protein and calcium from dairy products and high serum concentration of IGF-I were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. These results contribute to scientific evidence for appropriate public health strategies and prevention activities aimed at reducing the global cancer burden.},

A key factor affecting MCV impact is age, with infants receiving dose 1 (MCV1) at older ages having a reduced risk of vaccine failure, but also an increased risk of contracting infection before vaccination. Here, we designed a new method---based on a transmission model incorporating realistic vaccination delays and age variations in MCV1 effectiveness---to capture this risk trade-off and estimate the optimal age for recommending MCV1. We predict a large heterogeneity in the optimal ages (range: 6--20 months), contrasting the homogeneity of observed recommendations worldwide. Furthermore, we show that the optimal age depends on the local epidemiology of measles, with a lower optimal age predicted in populations suffering higher transmission. Overall, our results suggest the scope for public health authorities to tailor the recommended schedule for better measles control.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional regulation is a fundamental mechanism of living cells, which allows them to determine their actions and properties, by selectively choosing which proteins to express and by dynamically controlling the amounts of those proteins. In this article, we revisit the problem of mathematically modeling transcriptional regulation. First, we adopt a biologically motivated continuous model for gene transcription and mRNA translation, based on first-order rate equations, coupled with a set of nonlinear equations that model cis-regulation. Then, we view the processes of transcription and translation as being discrete, which, together with the need to use computational techniques for large-scale analysis and simulation, motivates us to model transcriptional regulation by means of a nonlinear discrete dynamical system. Classical arguments from chemical kinetics allow us to specify the nonlinearities underlying cis-regulation and to include both activators and repressors as well as the notion of regulatory modules in our formulation. We show that the steady-state behavior of the proposed discrete dynamical system is identical to that of the continuous model. We discuss several aspects of our model, related to homeostatic and epigenetic regulation as well as to Boolean networks, and elaborate on their significance. Simulations of transcriptional regulation of a hypothetical metabolic pathway illustrate several properties of our model, and demonstrate that a nonlinear discrete dynamical system may be effectively used to model transcriptional regulation in a biologically relevant way.},

PCV13 serotype IPD caused 37.4\% of total IPD cases, including 57.1\% and 25.2\% for countries with PCV10 or PCV13 in the pediatric NIP, respectively, most commonly due to serotypes 3 and 19A (11.4\% and 13.3\%, respectively, across all countries). In PCV10 countries, PCV15 and PCV20 would cover an additional 45.1\% and 55.6\% of IPD beyond serotypes contained in PCV10, largely due to coverage of serotype 19A. In PCV13 countries, PCV15 and PCV20 would cover an additional 10.6\% and 38.2\% of IPD beyond serotypes contained in PCV13. The most common IPD serotypes covered by higher valency PCVs were 10A (5.2\%), 12F (5.1\%), and 22F and 33F (3.5\% each).Much of the remaining IPD burden is due to serotypes included in PCV15 and PCV20.

Several conclusions are drawn, among them: a) model and variable forms should be selected based on regression diagnostic procedures, in addition to goodness-of-fit tests; b) variable-selection algorithms in current packaged programs, such as conventional stepwise regression, can easily lead to invalid estimates and tests of effect; and c) variable selection is better approached by direct estimation of the degree of confounding produced by each variable than by significance-testing algorithms. As a general rule, before using a model to estimate effects, one should evaluate the assumptions implied by the model against both the data and prior information.},

Kinetic studies of the proteolytic activation of (125)I-labeled human Hageman factor by human plasma kallikrein, plasma, activated Factor XI, and trypsin were performed in the presence and absence of high molecular weight kininogen and surface materials such as celite, kaolin, or ellagic acid. The results showed that surface-bound Hageman factor was 500 times more susceptible than soluble Hageman factor to proteolytic activation by kallikrein in the presence of high molecular weight kininogen. Surface binding of Hageman factor enhanced its cleavage by plasmin, activated Factor XI, and trypsin by 100-fold, 30-fold, and 5-fold, respectively. On a molar basis, trypsin was twice as potent as kallikrein in the cleavage of the surface-bound Hageman factor, while plasmin and activated Factor XI were an order of magnitude less potent than kallikrein. Kallikrein even at concentrations as low as 0.5 nM (i.e., 1/1000th of the concentration of prekallikrein in plasma) was very potent in the limited proteolysis of the surface-bound Hageman factor. These results suggest that substances classically known as "activating surfaces" promote the activation of Hageman factor indirectly by altering its structure such that it is much more susceptible to proteolytic activation by other plasma or cellular proteases.},

Within men's health, there is a need to consider how structural factors and men's socially-defined characteristics affect the relationship between sex, gender and health. The goal of an intersectional approach is to simultaneously examine the social and health effects of several key aspects of identity and context in ways that create a new understanding of these factors and that are a more accurate reflection of the lived experiences of the populations of interest. Despite their promise, intersectional approaches have been criticized for being difficult to operationalize and study systematically. This paper, however, presents a framework for studying the intersection of gender and other identities and characteristics that are relevant for men's health, and explicitly identifies key pathways and stratification variables to guide future research. This framework highlights pathways and ways to think about why race, gender, age and ethnicity affect men's health, and offers a tool for studying the relationship between socially-defined characteristics and men's health. Future research on men's health should begin by recognizing that comparing how men experience and embody masculinities may be most useful when researchers are explicit about their assumptions and theories about what and how socially-defined characteristics intersect with gender in a given national and local context. Research employing an intersectional approach also may elucidate how men of specific population groups create new normative masculinities for themselves. \copyright{} 2012 WPMH GmbH.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: While the use of spatially referenced data for the analysis of epidemiological data is growing, issues associated with selecting the appropriate geographic unit of analysis are also emerging. A particularly problematic unit is the ZIP code. Lacking standardization and highly dynamic in structure, the use of ZIP codes and ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTA) for the spatial analysis of disease present a unique challenge to researchers. Problems associated with these units for detecting spatial patterns of disease are explored. RESULTS: A brief review of ZIP codes and their spatial representation is conducted. Though frequently represented as polygons to facilitate analysis, ZIP codes are actually defined at a narrower spatial resolution reflecting the street addresses they serve. This research shows that their generalization as continuous regions is an imposed structure that can have serious implications in the interpretation of research results. ZIP codes areas and Census defined ZCTAs, two commonly used polygonal representations of ZIP code address ranges, are examined in an effort to identify the spatial statistical sensitivities that emerge given differences in how these representations are defined. Here, comparative analysis focuses on the detection of patterns of prostate cancer in New York State. Of particular interest for studies utilizing local, spatial statistical tests, is that differences in the topological structures of ZIP code areas and ZCTAs give rise to different spatial patterns of disease. These differences are related to the different methodologies used in the generalization of ZIP code information. Given the difficulty associated with generating ZIP code boundaries, both ZIP code areas and ZCTAs contain numerous representational errors which can have a significant impact on spatial analysis. While the use of ZIP code polygons for spatial analysis is relatively straightforward, ZCTA representations contain additional topological features (e.g. lakes and rivers) and contain fragmented polygons that can hinder spatial analysis. CONCLUSION: Caution must be exercised when using spatially referenced data, particularly that which is attributed to ZIP codes and ZCTAs, for epidemiological analysis. Researchers should be cognizant of representational errors associated with both geographies and their resulting spatial mismatch, especially when comparing the results obtained using different topological representations. While ZCTAs can be problematic, topological corrections are easily implemented in a geographic information system to remedy erroneous aggregation effects.},

METHODS We extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS The median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9\% of the patients were female. The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1\%), including 5.0\% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3\% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4\% who died. Only 1.9\% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3\% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3\% who had visited the city. The most common symptoms were fever (43.8\% on admission and 88.7\% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8\%). Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8\%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4\%). No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9\%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9\%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2\% of the patients on admission. CONCLUSIONS During the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness. Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings. (Funded by the National Health Commission of China and others.).},

Prominent risk factors for HCC include viral hepatitis infection; dietary exposure to hepatotoxic contaminants such as aflatoxins; alcoholism; smoking; and male gender. This review highlights ongoing efforts in HCC prevention. Strategies include vaccination against, and treatment of, viral hepatitis infection. In addition to interferon alpha, an acyclic retinoid (all-trans-3,7,11, 15-tetramethyl-2,4,6,10,14-hexadecapentanoic acid), glycyrrhizin and ginseng are currently under clinical investigation for HCC prevention in Japanese hepatitis C patients. Several recent clinical studies in a Chinese region of pervasive aflatoxin contamination also support the approach of favorably altering aflatoxin metabolism and excretion using the chemopreventive agents oltipraz or chlorophyllin. Agents exhibiting chemopreventive efficacy in preclinical HCC models include vitamins A, D, and E, herbal extracts, a 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, green tea, and D-limonene. Efforts to elucidate the molecular lesions and processes underlying HCC development have identified several putative molecular targets for preventive interventions. These include genes and gene products controlling viral replication, carcinogen metabolism, signal transduction, cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, proliferation, and oxidative stress.},

METHODS: Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database on white, black, and Hispanic women aged 66 to 85 years with breast cancer were examined for the receipt of adequate breast cancer care. RESULTS: Blacks were less likely than whites to receive adequate breast cancer care (odds ratio [OR], 0.78; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.86). Individuals, both black and white, who lived in areas with greater black segregation were less likely to receive adequate breast cancer care (OR, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.64-0.82). Black segregation was a mediator of the black/white disparity in breast cancer care, explaining 8.9\% of the difference. After adjustment, adequate care for Hispanics did not significantly differ from whites, but individuals, both Hispanic and white, who lived in areas with greater Hispanic segregation were less likely to receive adequate breast cancer care (OR, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.61-0.89). Although Blacks experienced greater breast cancer mortality than whites, black segregation did not substantially mediate the black-white disparity in survival, and was not significantly associated with mortality (hazards ratio, 1.03; 95\% CI, 0.87-1.21). Breast cancer mortality did not differ between Hispanics and whites. CONCLUSIONS: Among seniors, segregation mediates some of the black-white disparity in breast cancer care, but not mortality. Individuals who live in more segregated areas are less likely to receive adequate breast cancer care.},

  abstract = {With the unprecedented international migration seen in recent years, policies that limit health care access have become prevalent. Barriers to health care for undocumented immigrants go beyond policy and range from financial limitations, to discrimination and fear of deportation. This paper is aimed at reviewing the literature on barriers to health care for undocumented immigrants and identifying strategies that have or could be used to address these barriers. To address study questions, we conducted a literature review of published articles from the last 10 years in PubMed using three main concepts: immigrants, undocumented, and access to health care. The search yielded 341 articles of which 66 met study criteria. With regard to barriers, we identified barriers in the policy arena focused on issues related to law and policy including limitations to access and type of health care. These varied widely across countries but ultimately impacted the type and amount of health care any undocumented immigrant could receive. Within the health system, barriers included bureaucratic obstacles including paperwork and registration systems. The alternative care available (safety net) was generally limited and overwhelmed. Finally, there was evidence of widespread discriminatory practices within the health care system itself. The individual level focused on the immigrant's fear of deportation, stigma, and lack of capital (both social and financial) to obtain services. Recommendations identified in the papers reviewed included advocating for policy change to increase access to health care for undocumented immigrants, providing novel insurance options, expanding safety net services, training providers to better care for immigrant populations, and educating undocumented immigrants on navigating the system. There are numerous barriers to health care for undocumented immigrants. These vary by country and frequently change. Despite concerns that access to health care attracts immigrants, data demonstrates that people generally do not migrate to obtain health care. Solutions are needed that provide for noncitizens' health care.},

METHODS: Case patients included 28 injection drug users with acute hepatitis B and 20 with acute hepatitis C reported to the health department in a sentinel hepatitis surveillance county; control subjects were injection drug users with no markers of exposure to hepatitis B or C (n = 38 and 26, respectively) attending health department services during the same period. Data were abstracted from clinic records. RESULTS: Seventy-five percent of case patients with hepatitis B and 26\% of control subjects had never used the exchange; similar proportions were found for the hepatitis C case and control groups. After adjustment for demographic characteristics and duration of injecting drugs, nonuse of the exchange was associated with a sixfold greater risk of hepatitis B (odds ratio [OR] = 5.5; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5, 20.4) and a sevenfold greater risk of hepatitis C (OR = 7.3; 95\% CI = 1.6, 32.8). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that use of the exchange led to a significant reduction in hepatitis B and hepatitis C in the county and may have also prevented a substantial proportion of human immunodeficiency virus infections in injection drug users.},

  abstract = {Young injection drug users (IDUs) in San Francisco may be at high risk for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection despite access to several needle exchange venues. The authors conducted a cross-sectional study from 1997 to 1999 in San Francisco to estimate the prevalence and incidence of antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) among street-recruited IDUs under age 30, and to examine risk behaviors and sources of sterile needles. Among 308 participants, the prevalence of anti-HCV was 45\%. Using statistical modeling, incidence of HCV infection was estimated to be 11 per 100 person years. Independent risk factors for anti-HCV included age (odds ratio [OR], 1.17 per year; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.30), years injecting (OR, 1.21 per year; 95\% CI, 1.10-1.34), years in San Francisco (OR, 1.06 per year; 95\% CI, 1.00-1.14), first injected by a sex partner (OR, 4.06; 95\% CI, 1.74-9.52), injected daily (OR, 3.85; 95\% CI, 2.07-7.17), ever borrowed a needle (OR, 2.56; 95\% CI, 1.18-5.53), bleached last time a needle was borrowed (OR, 0.50; 95\% CI, 0.24-1.02), snorted or smoked drugs in the prior year (OR, 0.48; 95\% CI, 0.26-0.89), and injected by someone else in the prior month (OR, 0.50; 95\% CI, 0.25-0.99). In the prior month, 88\% used at least 1 of several needle exchange venues, and 32\% borrowed a needle. We conclude that anti-HCV prevalence is lower than in previous studies of older IDUs, but 11\% incidence implies high risk of HCV infection in a long injecting career. Despite access to sterile needles, borrowing of needles persisted.}

From 1 January 2020, the data capture government policies related to closure and containment, health and economic policy for more than 180 countries, plus several countries' subnational jurisdictions. Policy responses are recorded on ordinal or continuous scales for 19 policy areas, capturing variation in degree of response. We present two motivating applications of the data, highlighting patterns in the timing of policy adoption and subsequent policy easing and reimposition, and illustrating how the data can be combined with behavioural and epidemiological indicators. This database enables researchers and policymakers to explore the empirical effects of policy responses on the spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths, as well as on economic and social welfare.},

Multinomial logistic regression results show that free car parking at work is related to more driving. Commuters offered either public transportation benefits, showers/lockers, or bike parking, but no free car parking, are more likely to either ride public transportation, walk, or cycle to work. The joint provision of benefits for public transportation, walking, and cycling is related to an increased likelihood to commute by all three of these modes and a decreased likelihood of driving. However, the inclusion of free car parking in benefit packages alongside benefits for public transportation, walking, and cycling, seems to offset the effect of these incentives. Benefits for public transportation, walking, and cycling, seem to work best when car parking is not free.},

The study was conducted among symptomatic individuals of all ages enrolled in a cross-sectional community surveillance study in King County, Washington, from June 2020 to July 2022.Self-reported data for 15 demographic and health behavior variables and 16 symptoms.Reverse transcription--polymerase chain reaction--confirmed SARS-CoV-2 or rhinovirus infection.Analyses included data from 23\,498 individuals. The median (IQR) age of participants was 34.33 (22.42-45.08) years, 13\,878 (59.06\%) were female, 4018 (17.10\%) identified as Asian, 654 (2.78\%) identified as Black, and 2193 (9.33\%) identified as Hispanic. Close contact with an individual with SARS-CoV-2 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.89; 95\% CI, 3.34-4.57) and loss of smell or taste (aOR, 3.49; 95\% CI, 2.77-4.41) were the variables most associated with SARS-CoV-2 test positivity, but both attenuated during the Omicron period. Contact with a vaccinated individual with SARS-CoV-2 (aOR, 2.03; 95\% CI, 1.56-2.79) was associated with lower odds of testing positive than contact with an unvaccinated individual with SARS-CoV-2 (aOR, 4.04; 95\% CI, 2.39-7.23). Sore throat was associated with Omicron infection (aOR, 2.27; 95\% CI, 1.68-3.20) but not Delta infection. Vaccine effectiveness for participants fully vaccinated with a booster dose was 93\% (95\% CI, 73\%-100\%) for Delta, but not significant for Omicron. Variables associated with rhinovirus test positivity included being younger than 12 years (aOR, 3.92; 95\% CI, 3.42-4.51) and experiencing a runny or stuffy nose (aOR, 4.58; 95\% CI, 4.07-5.21). Black race, residing in south King County, and households with 5 or more people were significantly associated with both SARS-CoV-2 and rhinovirus test positivity.In this case-control study of 23\,498 symptomatic individuals, estimated risk factors and symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection changed over time. There was a shift in reported symptoms between the Delta and Omicron variants as well as reductions in the protection provided by vaccines. Racial and sociodemographic disparities persisted in the third year of SARS-CoV-2 circulation and were also present in rhinovirus infection. Trends in testing behavior and availability may influence these results.},

  abstract = {All but about 10\% of patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) (predominantly those infected with genotype 1) can respond to some degree to 'combination' therapy with interferon (IFN) and ribavirin. The slower the virological response to treatment, the less likely sustained viral clearance will take place. Many factors influence response to antiviral therapy; most cannot be reversed (e.g. sex, age, cirrhosis, genotype and viral load). A sustained viral clearance is considerably facilitated by compliance with full-dose therapy for the prescribed time. The potential cause(s) for non-response need(s) to be ascertained before attempting retreatment. The 10\% of patients who are true 'null' responders may respond to the new specifically targeted antiviral therapies but whether the response can be sustained off-therapy is unclear. Adjunctive therapies may facilitate response to retreatment if intolerance to treatment leading to diminished or absent doses was problematic in the past. Retreatment with a long-acting IFN and an adequate ribavirin dose (15 mg/kg), but given for 72 weeks in prior relapsers following 48 weeks of treatment, will enhance sustained virological response (SVR) rates. No benefit is gained from changing one pegylated IFNalpha (PEG IFNalpha) to another unless the treatment duration is extended. Only alpha-interferons are effective. For those individuals who still fail to achieve SVR, recruitment to trials of new treatments should be encouraged particularly for those with advanced liver disease. Lifestyle modification may be appropriate in attempt to reduce the chance of complications of liver disease, namely hepatocellular carcinoma, by smoking cessation, eliminating obesity and increasing coffee consumption.},

We investigated the frequency of metastatic infections in low-risk SAB patients, their clinical relevance, and whether omission of routine imaging is associated with worse outcomes.We performed a retrospective cohort study at 7 Dutch hospitals among adult patients with low-risk SAB, defined as hospital-acquired infection without treatment delay, absence of prosthetic material, short duration of bacteremia, and rapid defervescence. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients whose treatment plan changed due to detected metastatic infections, as evaluated by both actual therapy administered and by linking a adjudicated diagnosis to guideline-recommended treatment. Secondary outcomes were 90-day relapse-free survival and factors associated with the performance of diagnostic imaging.Of 377 patients included, 298 (79\%) underwent diagnostic imaging. In 15 of these 298 patients (5.0\%), imaging findings during patient admission had been interpreted as metastatic infections that should extend treatment. Using the final adjudicated diagnosis, 4 patients (1.3\%) had clinically relevant metastatic infection. In a multilevel multivariable logistic regression analysis, 90-day relapse-free survival was similar between patients without imaging and those who underwent imaging (81.0\% versus 83.6\%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.749; 95\% confidence interval, .373--1.504).Our study advocates risk stratification for the management of SAB patients. Prerequisites are follow-up blood cultures, bedside infectious diseases consultation, and a critical review of disease evolution. Using this approach, routine imaging could be omitted in low-risk patients.},

This study sought to evaluate PMN across 1 metropolitan area and assess relationships with underlying zip code--level measures. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study using data extracted from 1 regional community pharmacy market-share leader (October 2016--April 2017). Data included patient age, sex, payer, medication type, and home zip code. This zip code was connected to US census measures enumerating poverty and vehicle access, which were treated as continuous variables and within quintiles. The prescription-level outcome was whether prescriptions were not filled within 30 days of reaching the pharmacy. The ecologicallevel outcome was PMN calculated for each zip code (numerator, unfilled prescriptions; denominator, received prescriptions). RESULTS: There were 213\,719 prescriptions received by 54 included pharmacies; 12.2\% were unfilled. Older children, boys, and those with public insurance were more likely to have prescriptions not filled. Prescriptions originating from the highest poverty quintile were significantly more likely to not be filled than those from the lowest poverty quintile (adjusted odds ratio 1.60; 95\% confidence interval 1.52--1.69); a similar pattern was noted for vehicle access (adjusted odds ratio 1.77; 95\% confidence interval 1.68--1.87). At the ecological level, there were significant, graded relationships between PMN rates and poverty and vehicle access (both P {$<$} .0001); these gradients extended across all medication classes. CONCLUSIONS: Poverty and vehicle access are related to significant differences in prescriptionand ecological-level PMN across 1 metropolitan area. Pharmacists and pharmacies can be key partners in population health efforts.},

More-effective interventions to reduce the burden of cancer can be developed and implemented by the adoption of a transdisciplinary research framework that takes into account the social determinants of cancer and seeks to discover interactions among social, environmental, behavioral, and biological factors in cancer etiology. This paper addresses two critical issues in the science of team science: (1) a cross-disciplinary, multilevel framework for organizing future research, and (2) a perspective that could aid in the translation and dissemination of cancer research findings in health care and public health practice. This conceptual framework is designed to encourage transdisciplinary research that will integrate social determinants into cancer research. The authors' goal is to promote a more complete understanding of the causes of cancer that will lead to the improved translation and implementation of the results of research. ?? 2008 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.}

Records of subjective self assessment of asthma on a visual analogue scale and of peak flow (PEF) were compared in 12 subjects with asthma. PEF measurements were made with a coded meter for two weeks and an uncoded meter for two weeks in random order. The correlation between visual analogue scale score and PEF was invariably stronger when PEF was known. Changes in perception of asthma were measured by comparing the slopes and relative positions of the regressions of visual analogue on PEF. When PEF was uncoded awareness of asthma was significantly increased in five patients, predominantly those whose perception was poorest while they were using the coded meter, and decreased in only one patient. In two patients the results were unsuitable for this type of analysis. Knowledge of PEF therefore may influence subjective self assessment in patients with bronchial asthma. For objective studies of symptoms of asthma, PEF readings should be unknown to the patient. Perception of asthma may, however, be improved in patients with poor ability to detect changes in bronchial calibre by uncoded measurement of peak flow at home.},

  abstract = {The majority of new immigrants still settle in the traditional gateway cities; but as Douglas Massey and Chiara Capoferro show in chapter 2 of this volume, California and New York became much less dominant in the 1990s and during the early years of the new century than they were during the 1970s and 1980s. Immigrants now settle in small towns as well as large cities and in the interior as well as on the coasts. Immigrants have discovered the Middle West (see chapters 7 and 8 of this volume, by Katherine Fennelly and David Griffith, respectively) and the South (see chapter 6, by Katherine Donato and Carl L. Bankston III; chapter 9, by Helen B. Morrow; and chapter 10, by Jamie Winders) as well as traditional gateways in the East and West (see chapter 11, by Debra Lattanzi Shutika, and chapter 12, by Michael Jones-Correa). Given the virtual absence of immigrants in many regions of the United States up to 1990, even a small shift away from traditional gateways implied huge relative increases at new destinations. The absolute numbers of new immigrants arriving in Georgia, North Carolina, and Nevada may number only in the hundreds of thousands, but in relative terms the growth of immigrant communities in these areas is frequently off the charts.\textbackslash nIn recent years, the "immigration problem," as it has been widely labeled, has been the subject of repeated national commissions, investigative reports, and congressional legislation (Smith and Edmonston 1997, chapter 2). Although the apparent goal of American policy has been to cap or reduce immigration, the opposite has occurred. By 2000, there were over 30 million foreign-born persons in the United States, almost one third of whom arrived in the prior decade. Adding together these immigrants and their children (the second generation), more than 60 million people-or one in five Americans-have recent roots in other countries (U.S. Census Bureau 2005).\textbackslash nIn the middle decades of the twentieth century, the era of mass immigration was a distant memory for most Americans, but by the end of the century, immigration had become a major population trend shaping American society. Immigrants and the children of immigrants are a visible presence in American educational institutions, from kindergartens to graduate schools. Many businesses, including food processing, taxi driving, custodial services, construction, and, of course, agriculture and domestic service, are dependent on immigrant labor. All political parties are wooing Hispanic and Asian voters, many of whom are newly naturalized immigrants. Immigration is very likely to be a continuing influence on the size, shape, and composition of the American population for the foreseeable future.\textbackslash nThe increasing diversity of immigrant settlements is inextricably bound up with the growing volume of immigration. Even if there had been no proportional shift in destination patterns, there would have been sizable increases in the absolute numbers of immigrants going to new destinations. The doubling of immigration from the 1970s to the 1990s remains a fundamental reason why the presence of immigrants is evident in so many places with little history of recent immigration. However, the growing volume of immigration has also had additional indirect effects on the destination choices of new and secondary migrants, as immigrant niches in gateway cities become saturated, making labor-market opportunities in other areas seem more attractive (Light 2006).\textbackslash nThis volume offers new analyses and interpretations of the growth and settlement of immigrants in new destination areas. Drawing upon the empirical analyses assembled here, we can begin to see why immigration has become a national phenomenon and why immigrants are increasingly drawn to small and medium size towns throughout the United States. The studies reported here also offer tentative conclusions about the economic, social, political, and cultural responses to immigrant communities in new destinations. With their distinctive languages, appearances, and cultures, the new immigrants, along with their American-born children, at times encounter indifference and even hostility on occasion, but the dominant response still appears to be incorporation within the larger American "nation of immigrants.\textbackslash nThe magnitude and character of recent immigration to the United States, popularly known as the post-1965 wave of immigration, continue to surprise policymakers and many experts. The first surprise was that it happened at all. The 1965 amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act, also known as the Hart-Celler Law, were a product of the civil rights era of the 1960s. Ending the infamous national-origin quotas enacted in the 1920s-the central objective of the 1965 amendments-was a high priority for members of Congress, many of whom were the children and grandchildren of Southern and Eastern European immigrants who had been excluded early in the twentieth century. The expectation was that there would be a small blip in arrivals from Italy, Greece, and a few other European countries as families divided by the immigration restrictions of the 1920s were allowed to be reunited, but that no long-term increase would result (Reimers 1998, chapter 3).\textbackslash nThe latest surprise has been the shift in the geography of the new immigration (Singer 2004). One of the standard findings of research on the post- 1965 immigration wave during the 1970s and 1980s was its concentration in the states of New York, California, Texas, Florida, and Illinois, generally within a handful of "gateway" metropolitan areas such as New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Miami, and Chicago (Portes and Rumbaut 1996, chapter 2). Although different nationalities may have been concentrated in different areas (Puerto Ricans in New York, Cubans in Miami, Mexicans in Los Angeles, etc.) there was a common pattern and interpretation. Once immigrant pioneers had established a beachhead with ethnic neighborhoods and economic niches in certain industries, later immigrants flowed to the same places (Waldinger 1996; Waldinger and Lichter 2003). Migrants were drawn to immigrant-ethnic communities that could offer assistance to newcomers seeking housing, jobs, and the warmth of familiarity (Massey 1985).\textbackslash nThis expectation was not borne out, however. Almost 5 million immigrants came to the United States during the 1970s-the highest level of immigration, in both absolute and relative terms, since the early decades of the twentieth century (U.S. Department of Homeland Security 2003, 11). The 1970s were only the tip of the iceberg, however. The number of immigrants who arrived in the 1980s exceeded that of the 1970s, and both numbers were surpassed by arrivals in the 1990s. Not only were the numbers far higher than anyone expected, but the new immigrants came not so much from Europe but mainly from Latin America and Asia- regions that were not on the national agenda as sources for a major wave of immigration.\textbackslash nThe new criteria for admission under the 1965 act were family reunification and scarce occupational skills (Keely 1979). The new preference system allowed highly skilled professionals-primarily doctors, nurses, and engineers from Asian countries-to immigrate and eventually to sponsor the entry of their family members. About the same time, and largely independent of the 1965 Immigration Act, immigration from Latin America began to rise. Legal and undocumented migration from Mexico surged after a temporary-farm-worker program known as the Bracero Program was shut down in 1964 (Massey, Durand, and Malone 2002). Migration from Cuba arose from the tumult of Fidel Castro's revolution, as first elites and then professional, middle-class, and, finally, working class families fled persecution and the imposition of socialism in the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1980s, the Cubans were joined by refugees from Central American nations such as Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala (Lundquist and Massey 2005); and the collapse of the United States-backed government in South Vietnam after 1975 sent successive waves into the United States from Indochina (Massey 1995).

Seventeen seated subjects breathed via mouthpiece and nose-clip, maintaining constant tidal volumes at each of several breathing frequencies. Inspiratory breath hold was zero frequency. Log RSA was plotted vs. log frequency for each tidal volume. The large stable RSA for frequencies less than 6 cycles/min was called low-frequency intercept (LFI, 20 +/- 5 beats/min). Low-frequency intercept was inversely proportional to a subject's age only to 35 yr. At higher breathing frequencies above a characteristic corner frequency (fC, 7.2 +/- 1.5 cycles/min) RSA decreased with constant slope (roll-off; 21 +/- 3.4 dB/decade). The RSA-volume relationship was linear permitting normalization of RSA-frequency curves for tidal volume to yield one curve. Spontaneous breathing data points fell on this curve. Voluntarily coupling of heart rate to breathing frequency in integer ratios reduced breath-by-breath variability of RSA without changing mean RSA. In conclusion, low-frequency intercept, corner frequency, and roll-off characterize an individual's RSA-frequency relationship during both voluntarily controlled and spontaneous breathing.},

  abstract = {Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death, and its incidence is increasing in the United States. This analysis describes the association between race, treatment decisions, operative outcomes, and survival for patients with HCC. Methods The National Cancer Database was queried for all patients diagnosed with HCC from 1998 to 2011 (n = 143,692) who were white (76.9\%), black (14.7\%), or Asian (8.4\%). Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine factors that affected the likelihood of having surgery and postoperative mortality, and a Cox regression was performed to evaluate the effect of these factors on survival. Results The proportion of black patients with HCC increased in the United States during the 13-year period. There were no substantial differences among races in tumor size, grade, or overall clinical stage at the time of presentation; however, black patients were less likely to have surgery (odds ratio 0.69, 95\% confidence interval 0.67-0.72). Of patients who had surgery, there were no significant differences in pathologic stage, margin negative resection rate, or 30-day mortality; however, black patients had the longest interval between diagnosis and surgery, as well as the worst overall adjusted survival (hazard ratio 1.14, 95\% confidence interval 1.05-1.25). These findings were independent of HCC stage, insurance provider, and socioeconomic status. Conclusion Despite similar clinical presentation of HCC, substantial racial differences exist with regard to management and outcomes. Black patients are less likely to receive surgery for HCC and have worse long-term survival, despite similar perioperative quality metrics. This difference in long-term survival may highlight neighborhood, cultural, or biological differences between races.}

All groups of Americans were affected, but the growth in the number of uninsured people was particularly noticeable for whites, native-born citizens, and residents of the Midwest and South. Adults did not benefit nearly as much as children from public programs designed to offset the decline in employer-sponsored insurance and thus bore all of the burden of rising uninsurance. Throughout the past decade, even in good economic times, the number of Americans with employer-sponsored insurance has fallen, and the number of uninsured Americans has increased. This finding underscores the importance of planned coverage expansions under the Affordable Care Act.}

This new paradigm requires scaffolds that balance temporary mechanical function with mass transport to aid biological delivery and tissue regeneration. Little is known quantitatively about this balance as early scaffolds were not fabricated with precise porous architecture. Recent advances in both computational topology design (CTD) and solid free-form fabrication (SFF) have made it possible to create scaffolds with controlled architecture. This paper reviews the integration of CTD with SFF to build designer tissue-engineering scaffolds. It also details the mechanical properties and tissue regeneration achieved using designer scaffolds. Finally, future directions are suggested for using designer scaffolds with in vivo experimentation to optimize tissue-engineering treatments, and coupling designer scaffolds with cell printing to create designer material/biofactor hybrids.},

Methods: Data were drawn from three multi-site studies carried out in four major cities that enrolled IDUs over the period 1994-2004. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess relationships among sociodemographic characteristics, NEP use, injection risk behaviors, and prevalent or incident HCV infection. Results: Of the total participants (n = 4663), HCV seroprevalence was 37\%; among those who initially tested negative and completed follow-up at three, six, or 12~months (n = 1288), 12\% seroconverted. Nearly half of participants reported NEP (46\%) use at baseline. Multivariate results showed no significant relationship between NEP use and HCV seroconversion. Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, IDUs reporting NEP use were significantly less likely to share needles (aOR = 0.77, 95\% CI = 0.67-0.88). Additionally, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and program use, sharing needles, sharing other injection paraphernalia, longer injection duration, and injecting daily were all positively related to prevalent infection. Conclusions: Our results suggest an indirect protective effect of NEP use on HCV infection by reducing risk behavior.},

  abstract = {The complex epidemiology of vector-borne diseases creates significant challenges in the design and delivery of prevention and control strategies, especially in light of rapid social and environmental changes. Spatial models for predicting disease risk based on environmental factors such as climate and landscape have been developed for a number of important vector-borne diseases. The resulting risk maps have proven value for highlighting areas for targeting public health programs. However, these methods generally only offer technical information on the spatial distribution of disease risk itself, which may be incomplete for making decisions in a complex situation. In prioritizing surveillance and intervention strategies, decision-makers often also need to consider spatially explicit information on other important dimensions, such as the regional specificity of public acceptance, population vulnerability, resource availability, intervention effectiveness, and land use. There is a need for a unified strategy for supporting public health decision making that integrates available data for assessing spatially explicit disease risk, with other criteria, to implement effective prevention and control strategies. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a decision support tool that allows for the consideration of diverse quantitative and qualitative criteria using both data-driven and qualitative indicators for evaluating alternative strategies with transparency and stakeholder participation. Here we propose a MCDA-based approach to the development of geospatial models and spatially explicit decision support tools for the management of vector-borne diseases. We describe the conceptual framework that MCDA offers as well as technical considerations, approaches to implementation and expected outcomes. We conclude that MCDA is a powerful tool that offers tremendous potential for use in public health decision-making in general and vector-borne disease management in particular.},

  abstract = {Background: Patients who have had splenectomies are at increased risk for severe infections and overwhelming sepsis caused by pneumococci, meningococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and other encapsulated pathogens. Prophylactic measures are important to reduce mortality in this group; among them are vaccinations, antibiotic prophylaxis, and education. We performed a retrospective audit of post-splenectomy prophylactic measures, focusing on vaccinations and antibiotic prophylaxis coverage. Patients and Methods: We included 156 adult patients who had splenectomies between January 2010 and December 2018 in a study conducted at a single tertiary medical center. Data regarding vaccinations, antibiotic prophylaxis, and severe infections in the post-splenectomy period were obtained from medical records and supplemented by a patient-devised questionnaire. Results: Overall 121 of 156 (77.5\%) of patients received a basic pneumococcal vaccination, although only 27 of 70 (38.6\%) received re-vaccination after five years. Lower vaccination coverage was observed for meningococcal diseases and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease with 57.0\% (89/156) and 55.7\% (87/156) vaccination coverage, respectively. A difference in pneumococcal vaccination coverage between patients after elective splenectomy (81/91; 89.0\%) and non-elective splenectomy (40/65; 61.5\%) was observed. However, no difference was observed among meningococcal and Hib vaccination coverage. Antibiotic prophylaxis was recommended to patients more frequently after elective splenectomy (41/82; 50.0\%) than non-elective (16/56; 28.6\%) yet after an elective splenectomy, patients discontinued the prophylaxis more often than those after a non-elective surgery. Overall, only 30 of 146 (20.5\%) of patients received antibiotic prophylaxis over two years. In the observed period, 12.3\% of patients suffered a severe infection. Conclusion: Our study shows that there is adequate basic pneumococcal vaccination coverage among patients after a splenectomy particularly after an elective splenectomy, but there is a lack of and an inadequate implementation of other prophylactic measures. There is an urgent need for an organized approach involving better education of healthcare practitioners as well as patients concerning the risk of asplenia. In addition, an improved long-term follow-up is needed including establishing a central registry for the asplenic patients in Slovenia.},

However, some clinical isolates are mecA-positive and oxacillin-susceptible. Therefore, we surveyed the occurrence of S. aureus having the mecA gene and an MIC of oxacillin of less than 2 mg/l (oxacillin-susceptible MRSA; OS-MRSA) in a total of 480 strains of S. aureus collected from 11 hospitals in different location in Japan isolated from 2003 through 2005. We found 6 strains matching the criteria for OS-MRSA. All 6 strains were staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) mec-positive, without exception, and 4 strains showed the SCCmec type III-variant, which is unique in Japan. These OS-MRSAs were least resistant to oxacillin among the MRSAs tested and they were within the susceptible range to seven other beta-lactam antibiotics tested. Thus, OS-MRSA may become a high-resistant MRSA upon the treatment of patients with beta-lactam antibiotics. To characterize whether these OS-MRSAs were hospital-acquired or community-acquired MRSAs, we tested for the presence of the genes encoding toxins. Genes encoding hemolysin, exfoliative toxin, enterotoxin, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, and Panton-Valentine leukocidin were found in 6, 4, 0, 0, and 0 strains, respectively. These results revealed that OS-MRSAs could be classified as a new type of MRSA that exhibits properties distinguishable from either hospital- or community-acquired MRSA. Coagulase typing of the OS-MRSAs supported the above conclusion. In this study, the occurrence of OS-MRSA at a certain frequency was noted; precautions are called for in the classification of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus and in the treatment of OS-MRSA infection.},

These calls are grounded in extensive scholarship and the rationale that race is not a biological variable, but instead socially constructed, and that structural/institutional racism is a root cause of race-related health disparities. However, there remains a lack of clear guidance for how best to incorporate these assertions about race and racism into tools, such as causal diagrams, that are commonly used by epidemiologists to study population health. We provide clear recommendations for using causal diagrams to study racial health disparities that were informed by these calls. These recommendations consider a health disparity to be a difference in a health outcome that is related to social, environmental, or economic disadvantage. We present simplified causal diagrams to illustrate how to implement our recommendations. These diagrams can be modified based on the health outcome and hypotheses, or for other group-based differences in health also rooted in disadvantage (e.g., gender). Implementing our recommendations may lead to the publication of more rigorous and informative studies of racial health disparities.},

Results and Discussion: Demographic determinants of vaccine hesitancy that emerged in the literature review were age, income, educational attainment, health literacy, rurality, and parental status. Individual difference factors included mistrust in authority, disgust sensitivity, and risk aversion. Conclusion: Meeting target immunization rates will require robust public health campaigns that speak to individuals who are vaccine-hesitant in their attitudes and behaviours.

Methods: The 50 largest cities in the U.S. were the units of analysis. Numerator data were abstracted from national death files where the cause was malignant neoplasm of the breast (ICD-9. = 174 and ICD-10. = C50) for women. Population-based denominators were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau for 1990, 2000, and 2010. To measure the racial disparity, we calculated non-Hispanic Black:non-Hispanic White rate ratios (RRs) and confidence intervals for each 5-year period. Results: At the final time point (2005-2009), two RRs were less than 1, but neither significantly so, while 39 RRs were {$>$}1, 23 of them significantly so. Of the 41 cities included in the analysis, 35 saw an increase in the Black:White RR between 1990-1994 and 2005-2009. In many of the cities, the increase in the disparity occurred because White rates improved substantially over the 20-year study period, while Black rates did not. There were 1710 excess Black deaths annually due to this disparity in breast cancer mortality, for an average of about 5 each day. Conclusion: This analysis revealed large and growing disparities in Black:White breast cancer mortality in the U.S. and many of its largest cities during the period 1990-2009. Much work remains to achieve equality in breast cancer mortality outcomes. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Objectives This study reports a high-volume tertiary care center experience with the microbiology of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED) infections with assessment of temporal trends and profiles of late versus early infections. Background The rates of CIED infections have been increasing. With changing demographics, patient and device characteristics, prophylactic measures, and the wide use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, there is need for updated contemporary data on the microbiology of CIED infections. Methods The study included 816 consecutive patients with confirmed CIED infections who underwent transvenous lead extraction at our institution between the years 2000 and 2011. Blood cultures were obtained in addition of pocket swabs, pocket capsule, and leads. Results Staphylococcal species remained the most common pathogens in CIED infections (68.4\%), especially coagulase-negative species (37.6\%). Methicillin-resistant staphylococci were the pathogens in 33.8\% of all CIED infections and accounted for 49.4\% of all staphylococcal infections. Gram-negative pathogens were identified in 8.9\% of cases, whereas 13.2\% were with negative cultures. CIED infections related to streptococci (2.5\%), enterococci (4.2\%), anaerobes (1.6\%), fungi (0.9\%), and mycobacteria species (0.2\%) were less common. Of pocket infections, 49.5\% occurred more than 1 year after pocket manipulation, and 53.6\% of these were related to coagulase-negative staphylococci. In contrast, most endovascular infections were related to Staphylococcus aureus. The proportions of culture negative infections have increased (p~{$<$} 0.0001). Conclusions The study provides contemporary data on the microbiology of CIED infections. The rates of methicillin resistance seem to be greater than those reported from the preceding decade.},

The resulting model agrees with almost all experimentally known stationary concentrations and metabolic fluxes, with the frequency of oscillation and with the majority of other experimentally known kinetic and dynamical variables.

  abstract = {Causal mediation analysis is routinely conducted by applied researchers in a variety of disciplines. The goal of such an analysis is to investigate alternative causal mechanisms by examining the roles of intermediate variables that lie in the causal paths between the treatment and outcome variables. In this paper we first prove that under a particular version of sequential ignorability assumption, the average causal mediation effect (ACME) is nonparametrically identified. We compare our identification assumption with those proposed in the literature. Some practical implications of our identification result are also discussed. In particular, the popular estimator based on the linear structural equation model (LSEM) can be interpreted as an ACME estimator once additional parametric assumptions are made. We show that these assumptions can easily be relaxed within and outside of the LSEM framework and propose simple nonparametric estimation strategies. Second, and perhaps most importantly, we propose a new sensitivity analysis that can be easily implemented by applied researchers within the LSEM framework. Like the existing identifying assumptions, the proposed sequential ignorability assumption may be too strong in many applied settings. Thus, sensitivity analysis is essential in order to examine the robustness of empirical findings to the possible existence of an unmeasured confounder. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to a randomized experiment from political psychology. We also make easy-to-use software available to implement the proposed methods.},

  abstract = {Background \& Aims: Previous studies have reported a high frequency of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence in patients with advanced liver disease, after receipt of interferon (IFN)-free therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Our objective was to verify and account for this phenomenon using data from the Scottish HCV clinical database. Methods: We identified HCC-na\"ive individuals with liver cirrhosis receiving a course of antiviral therapy in Scotland from 1997-2016 resulting in a sustained virologic response. Patients were followed-up from their treatment start date to the earliest of: date of death, date of HCC occurrence, or 31 January 2017. We used Cox regression to compare the risk of HCC occurrence according to treatment regimen after adjusting for relevant co-factors (including: demographic factors; baseline liver disease stage; comorbidities/health behaviours, virology, and previous treatment experience). HCC occurrence was ascertained through both the HCV clinical database and medical chart review. For our main analysis, treatment regimen was defined as IFN-free vs. IFN-containing. Results: A total of 857 patients met the study criteria, of whom 31.7\% received an IFN-free regimen. Individuals receiving IFN-free therapy were more likely to be: older; of white ethnicity, Child-Turcotte-Pugh B/C vs. Child-Turcotte-Pugh A; thrombocytopenic; non-genotype 3; and treatment experienced. HCC occurrence was observed in 46 individuals during follow-up. In univariate analysis, IFN-free therapy was associated with a significantly increased risk of HCC (HR: 2.48; p = 0.021). However, after multivariate adjustment for baseline factors, no significant risk attributable to IFN-free therapy persisted (aHR: 1.15, p = 0.744). Conclusion: These findings suggest that the higher incidence of HCC following sustained virologic response with IFN-free therapy relates to baseline risk factors/patient selection, and not the use of IFN-free therapy per se. Lay summary: We examined the risk of liver cancer in 857 patients with cirrhosis in Scotland who received hepatitis C antiviral therapy and achieved a cure. We compared the risk of first-time liver cancer in patients treated with the newest interferon-free regimens, to patients treated with interferon. After accounting for the different characteristics of these two treatment groups, we found no evidence that interferon-free therapy is associated with a higher risk of liver cancer.},

Our objective was to forecast the population impact of possible prioritisation strategies for the resource-rich setting of Scotland.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nDESIGN: We created a dynamic Markov simulation model to reflect the HCV-infected population in Scotland. We determined trends in key outcomes (e.g. incident cases of chronic infection and severe liver morbidity (SLM)) until the year 2030, according to treatment strategies involving prioritising, either: (A) persons with moderate/advanced fibrosis or (B) persons who inject drugs (PWID).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Continuing to treat the same number of patients with the same characteristics will give rise to a fall in incident infection (from 600 cases in 2015 to 440 in 2030) and a fall in SLM (from 195 cases in 2015 to 145 in 2030). Doubling treatment-uptake and prioritising PWID will reduce incident infection to negligible levels ({$<$}50 cases per year) by 2025, while SLM will stabilise (at 70-75 cases per year) in 2028. Alternatively, doubling the number of patients treated, but, instead, prioritising persons with moderate/advanced fibrosis will reduce incident infection less favourably (only to 280 cases in 2030), but SLM will stabilise by 2023 (i.e. earlier than any competing strategy).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Prioritising treatment uptake among PWID will substantially impact incident transmission, however, this approach foregoes the optimal impact on SLM. Conversely, targeting those with moderate/advanced fibrosis has the greatest impact on SLM but is suboptimal in terms of averting incident infection.},

We conducted a large-scale population-based cohort study of the association between coffee drinking and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a Japanese population. METHODS: Newly diagnosed case patients (250 men and 84 women) with HCC were identified from a 10-year follow-up of the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study, which consists of 90,452 middle-aged and elderly Japanese subjects (43,109 men and 47,343 women). Case patients were grouped according to coffee intake and were stratified by hepatitis virus infection, sex, age, diet, lifestyle factors, and previous history of liver disease. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for HCC were calculated with Cox proportional-hazards modeling. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Subjects (men and women combined) who consumed coffee on a daily or almost daily basis had a lower HCC risk than those who almost never drank coffee (HR = 0.49 [95\% CI = 0.36 to 0.66]); risk decreased with the amount of coffee consumed (compared with nondrinkers, the HR for 1-2 cups per day = 0.52 [95\% CI = 0.38 to 0.73]; for 3-4 cups per day = 0.48 [95\% CI = 0.28 to 0.83]; for {$>$} or =5 cups per day = 0.24 [95\% CI = 0.08 to 0.77], P(trend) {$<$} .001). The risk of liver cancer in almost never drinkers in this population was 547.2 cases per 100,000 people over 10 years, but it was 214.6 cases per 100 000 people with drinking coffee on a daily basis. The inverse association persisted when the participants were stratified by lifestyle factors. Similar associations were observed when the analysis was restricted to hepatitis C virus-positive patients (all daily drinkers compared with nondrinkers: HR =0.57 [95\% CI = 0.37 to 0.86]), to hepatitis B virus-positive patients (HR = 0.60 [95\% CI = 0.31 to 1.18]) and to subjects with no past history of chronic liver disease (HR = 0.45 [95\% CI = 0.30 to 0.67]). CONCLUSIONS: In the Japanese population, habitual coffee drinking may be associated with reduced risk of HCC.},

While these electrospun fibrous scaffolds provide physical cues that can direct tissue formation when seeded with cells, the ability to chemically guide a population of cells, without disrupting scaffold mechanical properties, would improve the maturation of such constructs and add additional functionality to the system both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we developed a fabrication technique to entrap drug-delivering microspheres within nanofibrous scaffolds. We hypothesized that entrapping microspheres between fibers would have a less adverse impact on mechanical properties than placing microspheres within the fibers themselves, and that the composite would exhibit sustained release of multiple model compounds. Our results show that microspheres ranging from 10 - 20 microns in diameter could be electrospun in a dose-dependent manner to form nanofibrous composites. When delivered in a sacrificial PEO fiber population, microspheres remained securely entrapped between slow-degrading PCL fibers after removal of the sacrificial delivery component. Stiffness and modulus of the composite decreased with increasing microsphere density for composites in which microspheres were entrapped within each fiber, while stiffness did not change when microspheres were entrapped between fibers. The release profiles of the composite structures were similar to free microspheres, with an initial burst release followed by a sustained release of the model molecules over 4 weeks. Further, multiple model molecules were released from a single scaffold composite, demonstrating the capacity for multi-factor controlled release ideal for complex growth factor delivery from these structures.},

Whether a shift from intravenous to oral antibiotics once the patient is in stable condition would result in efficacy and safety similar to those with continued intravenous treatment is unknown. METHODS: In a randomized, noninferiority, multicenter trial, we assigned 400 adults in stable condition who had endocarditis on the left side of the heart caused by streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, or coagulase-negative staphylococci and who were being treated with intravenous antibiotics to continue intravenous treatment (199 patients) or to switch to oral antibiotic treatment (201 patients). In all patients, antibiotic treatment was administered intravenously for at least 10 days. If feasible, patients in the orally treated group were discharged to outpatient treatment. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, unplanned cardiac surgery, embolic events, or relapse of bacteremia with the primary pathogen, from the time of randomization until 6 months after antibiotic treatment was completed. RESULTS: After randomization, antibiotic treatment was completed after a median of 19 days (interquartile range, 14 to 25) in the intravenously treated group and 17 days (interquartile range, 14 to 25) in the orally treated group (P=0.48). The primary composite outcome occurred in 24 patients (12.1\%) in the intravenously treated group and in 18 (9.0\%) in the orally treated group (between-group difference, 3.1 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval, -3.4 to 9.6; P=0.40), which met noninferiority criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with endocarditis on the left side of the heart who were in stable condition, changing to oral antibiotic treatment was noninferior to continued intravenous antibiotic treatment.

  abstract = {The measurement of spatial segregation has often used measures such as the Neighborhood Sorting Index (NSI) or the Index of Dissimilarity (D) that do not take full account of space. We propose a Generalized Neighborhood Sorting Index (GNSI), an extension of NSI, in which each neighborhood is part of a broader community, the extent of which can be easily changed by increasing the order of contiguity or the allowable distance between neighborhood centroids. The GNSI has desirable characteristics as a valid spatial measure of segregation and significantly alleviates the checkerboard problem while NSI and similar measures are insensitive to the spatial arrangement of the geographic units in the analysis, such as census tracts. An application of GNSI to the ten largest metropolitan areas reveals that the GNSI gives a more complete account of the extent of economic segregation and the changes over time, and ranks the metropolitan areas differently in term of the level and changes in economic segregation.},

  abstract = {Objective To examine time trends in disparities in low-income children's health insurance coverage and access to care by family immigration status. Methods We used data from the National Survey of Children's Health in 2003 to 2011-2012, including 83,612 children aged 0 to 17 years with family incomes {$<$}200\% of the federal poverty level. We examined 3 immigration status categories: citizen children with nonimmigrant parents; citizen children with immigrant parents; and immigrant children. We used multivariable regression analyses to obtain adjusted trends in health insurance coverage and access to care. Results All low-income children experienced gains in health insurance coverage and access to care from 2003 to 2011-2012, regardless of family immigration status. Relative to citizen children with nonimmigrant parents, citizen children with immigrant parents had a 5 percentage point greater increase in health insurance coverage (P =.06), a 9 percentage point greater increase in having a personal doctor or nurse (P {$<$}.01), and an 11 percentage point greater increase in having no unmet medical need (P {$<$}.01). Immigrant children had significantly lower health insurance coverage than other groups. However, the group had a 14 percentage point greater increase in having a personal doctor or nurse (P {$<$}.01) and a 26 percentage point greater increase in having no unmet medical need (P {$<$}.01) relative to citizen children with nonimmigrant parents. Conclusions Some disparities in access to care related to family immigration status have lessened over time among children in low-income families, although large disparities still exist. Policy efforts are needed to ensure that children of immigrant parents and immigrant children are able to access health insurance and health care.},

Because such events likely affect cellular proliferation, we investigated the impact of HCMV infection on key components of the cell cycle. Early after infection, HCMV induced elevated levels of cyclin E, cyclin E-associated kinase activity, and two tumor suppressor proteins, p53 and the retinoblastoma gene product (Rb). The steady-state concentration of Rb continued to rise throughout the infection, with most of the protein remaining in the highly phosphorylated form. At early times, HCMV infection also induced cyclin B accumulation, which was associated with a significant increase in mitosis-promoting factor activity as the infection progresses. In contrast, the levels of cyclin A and cyclin A-associated kinase activity increased only at late times in the infection, and the kinetics were delayed relative to those for cyclins E and B. Analysis of the cellular DNA content in the infected cells by flow cytometry showed a progressive shift of the cells from the G1 to the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, leading to an accumulation of aneuploid cells at late times. We propose that these HCMV-mediated perturbations result in cell cycle arrest in G2/M.},

This cross-sectional study used data from the 2003 California Health Interview Survey to identify 1404 children (ages 0-11) with a special health care need. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were used to examine relations between immigrant status and health access, utilization, and health status variables. Compared to children with special health care needs (CSHCN) in nonimmigrant families, CSHCN in immigrant families are more likely to be uninsured (10.4 vs. 4.8\%), lack a usual source of care (5.9 vs. 1.9\%), report a delay in medical care (13.0 vs. 8.1\%), and report no visit to the doctor in the past year (6.8 vs. 2.6\%). They are less likely to report an emergency room visit in the past year (30.0 vs. 44.0\%), yet more likely to report fair or poor perceived health status (33.0 vs. 16.0\%). Multivariate analyses suggested that the bivariate findings for children with SHCN in immigrant families largely reflected differences in family socioeconomic status, parent's language, parental education, ethnicity, and children's insurance status. Limited resources, non-English language, and limited health-care use are some of the barriers to staying healthy for CSHCN in immigrant families. Public policies that improve access to existing insurance programs and provide culturally and linguistically appropriate care will likely decrease health and health care disparities for this population.},

Combination therapy with daptomycin and ceftaroline (DAP+CPT) represents a novel therapeutic approach to MRSA-BSI owing to synergistic bactericidal activity. This study aimed to compare DAP+CPT with historical standard of care (SoC) for treatment of complicated MRSA-BSI. This single-centre retrospective cohort study included patients with complicated MRSA-BSI at University of Colorado Hospital. Patients receiving DAP+CPT for {$\geq$}48 h between November 2013 and March 2020 or SoC with vancomycin or DAP \textpm{} gentamicin and/or rifampicin from November 2011 to December 2013 were compared. The primary outcome was clinical failure defined as a composite of MRSA-related mortality and recurrent infection at 60 days. A total of 60 patients received DAP+CPT (n~=~30) or SoC (n~=~30). Median age was 56 years and median Pitt bacteremia score was 3. Common infectious sites were endovascular (63\%) and musculoskeletal (40\%). DAP+CPT was associated with a numerically lower incidence of clinical failure compared with SoC (20\% vs. 43\%; P~=~0.052). Multivariable analysis controlling for immunocompromised status (OR, 6.90, 95\% CI 1.08-44.15), Charlson comorbidity index (OR, 1.12, 95\% CI 0.90-1.39) and source control (OR, 0.35, 95\% CI 0.08-1.46) associated DAP+CPT with 77\% lower odds of clinical failure (OR, 0.23, 95\% CI 0.06-0.89). In patients with complicated MRSA-BSI with delayed clearance, DAP+CPT trended towards lower rates of clinical failure than SoC and was significantly associated with decreased clinical failure after adjustment for baseline differences.},

After describing the levels of segregation in each, the article tests a model based on generic factors that should influence segregation levels in all five countries and then evaluates---for the urban population as a whole, for the ``charter group'' in each society, and for various ethnic minority groups---whether there are also significant country-specific variations in segregation levels.

Hypotheses were tested using separate Poisson, linear, and logistic regression models that corrected for spatial autocorrelation. Census block groups served as the unit of analysis (n = 450). We found that higher concentrations of African Americans were associated with higher homicide rates as well as greater alcohol availability, especially malt liquor availability. The promotion of malt liquor on storefronts was also significantly greater in African American than in other neighborhoods. However, none of the measures representing alcohol or malt liquor availability and promotion variables changed the effect of neighborhood racial/ethnic concentration on homicide.

We aimed to identify associations between race and survival after HCC diagnosis in a diverse American population. Methods: Using the cancer registry from Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami and Jackson Memorial Hospitals, we performed retrospective analysis of 999 patients diagnosed with HCC between 9/24/2004 and 12/19/2014. We identified clinical characteristics by reviewing available electronic medical records. The association between race and survival was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: Median survival in days was 425 in Blacks, 904.5 in non-Hispanic Whites, 652 in Hispanics, 570 in Asians, and 928 in others, p~{$<~$}0.01. Blacks and Asians presented at more advanced stages with larger tumors. Although Whites had increased severity of liver disease at diagnosis compared to other races, they had 36\% reduced rate of death compared to Blacks, [hazard ratio (HR) 0.64, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.51--0.8, p~{$<~$}0.01]. After adjusting for significant covariates, Whites had 22\% (HR 0.78, 95\% CI 0.61--0.99, p 0.04) reduced risk of death, compared to Blacks. Transplant significantly reduced rate of death; however, only 13.3\% of Blacks had liver transplant, compared to 40.1\% of Whites, p~{$<~$}0.01. Conclusions: In this diverse sample of patients, survival among Blacks is the shortest after HCC diagnosis. Survival differences reflect a more advanced tumor stage at presentation rather than severity of underlying liver disease precluding treatment. Improving survival in minority populations, in whom HCC incidence is rapidly increasing, requires identification and modification of factors contributing to late-stage presentation.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor access to immunisation services remains a major barrier to achieving equity and expanding vaccination coverage in many sub-Saharan African countries. In Kenya, the extent to which spatial access affects immunisation coverage is not well understood. The aim of this study was to quantify spatial accessibility to immunising health facilities and determine its influence on immunisation uptake in Kenya while controlling for potential confounders. METHODS: Spatial databases of immunising facilities, road network, land use and elevation were used within a cost friction algorithim to estimate the travel time to immunising health facilities. Two travel scenarios were evaluated; (1) Walking only and (2) Optimistic scenario combining walking and motorized transport. Mean travel time to health facilities and proportions of the total population living within 1-h to the nearest immunising health facility were computed. Data from a nationally representative cross-sectional survey (KDHS 2014), was used to estimate the effect of mean travel time at survey cluster units for both fully immunised status and third dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DPT3) vaccine using multi-level logistic regression models. RESULTS: Nationally, the mean travel time to immunising health facilities was 63 and 40\,min using the walking and the optimistic travel scenarios respectively. Seventy five percent of the total population were within one-hour of walking to an immunising health facility while 93\% were within one-hour considering the optimistic scenario. There were substantial variations across the country with 62\%(29/47) and 34\%(16/47) of the counties with {$<$}\,90\% of the population within one-hour from an immunising health facility using scenarios 1 and 2 respectively. Travel times {$>$}\,1-h were significantly associated with low immunisation coverage in the univariate analysis for both fully immunised status and DPT3 vaccine. Children living more than 2-h were significantly less likely to be fully immunised [AOR:0.56(0.33-0.94) and receive DPT3 [AOR:0.51(0.21-0.92) after controlling for household wealth, mother's highest education level, parity and urban/rural residence. CONCLUSION: Travel time to immunising health facilities is a barrier to uptake of childhood vaccines in regions with suboptimal accessibility ({$>$}\,2-h). Strategies that address access barriers in the hardest to reach communities are needed to enhance equitable access to immunisation services in Kenya.},

We examined COVID-19 outcomes of people of various Asian ethnic subgroups and other racial and ethnic groups in an urban safety net hospital system. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 85 328 adults aged {$\geq$}18 tested for COVID-19 at New York City's public hospital system from March 1 through May 31, 2020. We examined COVID-19 positivity, hospitalization, and mortality, as well as demographic characteristics and comorbidities known to worsen COVID-19 outcomes. We conducted adjusted multivariable regression analyses examining racial and ethnic disparities in mortality. Results: Of 9971 Asian patients (11.7\% of patients overall), 48.2\% were South Asian, 22.2\% were Chinese, and 29.6\% were in other Asian ethnic groups. South Asian patients had the highest rates of COVID-19 positivity (30.8\%) and hospitalization (51.6\%) among Asian patients, second overall only to Hispanic (32.1\% and 45.8\%, respectively) and non-Hispanic Black (27.5\% and 57.5\%, respectively) patients. Chinese patients had a mortality rate of 35.7\%, highest of all racial and ethnic groups. After adjusting for demographic characteristics and comorbidities, only Chinese patients had significantly higher odds of mortality than non-Hispanic White patients (odds ratio = 1.44; 95\% CI, 1.04-2.01). Conclusions: Asian American people, particularly those of South Asian and Chinese descent, bear a substantial and disproportionate health burden of COVID-19. These findings underscore the need for improved data collection and reporting and public health efforts to mitigate disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among these groups.},

The significance of transportation barriers can weigh more than the issues of access to care. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine transportation and other nonfinancial barriers among low-income uninsured patients of a safety net health-care facility (free clinic). Methods: The survey data were collected from patients aged 18 years and older who spoke English or Spanish at a free clinic, which served uninsured individuals in poverty in the United States. Results: Levels of transportation barriers were associated with levels of other nonfinancial barriers. Higher levels of nonfinancial barriers were associated with elevation in levels of stress and poorer self-rated general health. Higher educational attainment and employment were associated with an increase in other nonfinancial barriers. Conclusion: Focusing only on medical interventions might not be sufficient for the well-being of the underserved populations. Future studies should examine integrative care programs that include medical treatment and social services together and evaluate such programs to improve care for underserved populations.},

METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: The investigation was conducted between 2004 and 2007 and consisted of 45 newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma patients and 90 individually gender- and age-matched hospital controls. Conditional univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied. RESULTS: A highly statistically significant association (P = 0.001) was demonstrated between hepatocellular carcinoma and HBsAg positivity and the presence of hepatitis C virus antibodies. Diabetes mellitus was significantly (P = 0.018) associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. A statistically significant inverse association was shown between low parity and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (P = 0.033). The risk increased significantly with a longer history of cigarette smoking (P = 0.044), as well as the daily consumption of hard liquor (P = 0.049). A weekly intake of fish (P = 0.003) and yogurt (P = 0.003) and daily intake of boiled vegetables (P = 0.001) were reported more frequently by controls than hepatocellular carcinoma cases. In the current study, a high intake of salty food also significantly increased the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (P = 0.027). Based on multivariate analysis, the presence of hepatitis C virus antibodies (OR = 24.6, P = 0.001) and duration of smoking {$>$} or =25 years (OR = 3.8, P = 0.020) were significantly related to hepatocellular carcinoma, whereas the daily consumption of boiled vegetables (OR = 0.1, P = 0.011) was inversely associated with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: The findings obtained in the current study support the hypotheses that non-viral factors, such as lifestyle factors, reproductive factors, and a history of diabetes, might be involved in the etiology of hepatocellular carcinoma.},

  abstract = {Background:\enspace{} The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has infected millions of people and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. While COVID-19 has overwhelmed healthcare resources (e.g., healthcare personnel, testing resources, hospital beds, and ventilators) in a number of countries, limited research has been conducted to understand spatial accessibility of such resources. This study fills this gap by rapidly measuring the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources with a particular focus on Illinois, USA. Method:\enspace{} The rapid measurement is achieved by resolving computational intensity of an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method through a parallel computing strategy based on cyberGIS (cyber geographic infor-mation science and systems). The E2SFCA has two major steps. First, it calculates a bed-to-population ratio for each hospital location. Second, it sums these ratios for residential locations where hospital locations overlap. Results:\enspace{} The comparison of the spatial accessibility measures for COVID-19 patients to those of population at risk identifies which geographic areas need additional healthcare resources to improve access. The results also help delin-eate the areas that may face a COVID-19-induced shortage of healthcare resources. The Chicagoland, particularly the southern Chicago, shows an additional need for resources. This study also identified vulnerable population residing in the areas with low spatial accessibility in Chicago. Conclusion:\enspace{} Rapidly measuring spatial accessibility of healthcare resources provides an improved understanding of how well the healthcare infrastructure is equipped to save people's lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings are relevant for policymakers and public health practitioners to allocate existing healthcare resources or distribute new resources for maximum access to health services.},

  abstract = {The physiological inertness of synthetic implant materials often results in insufficient implant integration and limited acceptance of implants in tissues. After implantation the implant surface is often separated from the surrounding healthy and regenerating tissue, for example by a fibrous capsule. To avoid this host-versus-graft reaction, a strong mechanical contact between tissue and implant must be ensured. An enhanced contact between graft and the surrounding tissue can be provided by coating the implant with cell-adhesive molecules. The highly active and alpha(v)beta(3)- and alpha(v)beta(5)-integrin-selective peptide c(-RGDfK-) (f=D-phenylalanine) was functionalized with various linker molecules containing an acrylamide end group by using the lysine side chain of c(-RGDfK-). The acrylamide group can be used to bind the peptide covalently to poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) surfaces. The coated surfaces effectively bind to murine osteoblasts as well as human osteoblasts in vitro when a minimum distance of 3.5 nm between surface and the constrained RGD sequence is provided. In contrast to osteoblasts in cell suspension, surface-bound osteoblasts show no apoptosis but proliferate by a factor of 10 over a 22 d period. Coating of inert implant surfaces with highly active and alpha(v)-selective peptides affords a marked improvement in osteoblast binding over current technologies. In vivo studies show that peptide-coated PMMA pellets implanted into the patella groove of rabbits are integrated into the regenerating bone tissue faster and more strongly than uncoated pellets.},

In the face of persistent lack of access to opioids by patients with legitimate pain problems, the rate of prescription opioid abuse in the United States has escalated over the past 15 years. Abuse-deterrent opioid products can play a central role in optimizing the risk-benefit ratio of opioid analgesics--if these products can be developed cost-effectively without compromising efficacy or creating new safety issues for the target treatment population. The development of scientific methods for assessing prescription opioid abuse potential remains a critical and challenging step in determining whether a claim of abuse deterrence for a new opioid product is indeed valid and will thus be accepted by the medical, regulatory, and reimbursement communities. To explore this and other potential impediments to the development of prescription opioid abuse-deterrent formulations, a panel of experts on opioid abuse and diversion from academia, industry, and governmental agencies participated in a Tufts Health Care Institute-supported symposium held on October 27 and 28, 2005, in Boston, MA. This manuscript captures the main consensus opinions of those experts, and also information gleaned from a review of the relevant published literature, to identify major impediments to the development of opioid abuse-deterrent formulations and offer strategies that may accelerate their commercialization.},

The second approach treats race as a proxy for class and views socioeconomic stratification as the real culprit behind racial disparities. The third approach treats race as neither a biological category nor a proxy for class, but as a distinct construct, akin to caste. We point to historical, political, and ideological obstacles that have hindered the analysis of race and class as codeterminants of disparities in health.}

  abstract = {Insulin resistance is one of the pathological features in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Generally, persistence of insulin resistance leads to an increase in the risk of life-threatening complications such as cardiovascular diseases. However, these complications are not major causes of death in patients with HCV-associated insulin resistance. Indeed, insulin resistance plays a crucial role in the development of various complications and events associated with HCV infection. Mounting evidence indicates that HCV-associated insulin resistance may cause (1) hepatic steatosis; (2) resistance to anti-viral treatment; (3) hepatic fibrosis and esophageal varices; (4) hepatocarcinogenesis and proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma; and (5) extrahepatic manifestations. Thus, HCV-associated insulin resistance is a therapeutic target at any stage of HCV infection. Although the risk of insulin resistance in HCV-infected patients has been documented, therapeutic guidelines for preventing the distinctive complications of HCV-associated insulin resistance have not yet been established. In addition, mechanisms for the development of HCV-associated insulin resistance differ from lifestyle-associated insulin resistance. In order to ameliorate HCV-associated insulin resistance and its complications, the efficacy of the following interventions is discussed: a late evening snack, coffee consumption, dietary iron restriction, phlebotomy, and zinc supplements. Little is known regarding the effect of anti-diabetic agents on HCV infection, however, a possible association between use of exogenous insulin or a sulfonylurea agent and the development of HCC has recently been reported. On the other hand, insulin-sensitizing agents are reported to improve sustained virologic response rates. In this review, we summarize distinctive complications of, and therapeutic strategies for, HCV-associated insulin resistance. Furthermore, we discuss supplementation with branched-chain amino acids as a unique insulin-sensitizing strategy for patients with HCV-associated insulin resistance.},

  abstract = {Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection disrupts the normal metabolism processes, but is also influenced by several of the host's metabolic factors. An obvious and significantly detrimental pathophysiological feature of HCV infection is insulin resistance in hepatic and peripheral tissues. Substantial research efforts have been put forth recently to elucidate the molecular mechanism of HCV-induced insulin resistance, and several cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, have been identified as important contributors to the development of insulin resistance in the distant peripheral tissues of HCV-infected patients and animal models. The demonstrated etiologies of HCV-induced whole-body insulin resistance include oxidative stress, lipid metabolism abnormalities, hepatic steatosis and iron overload. In addition, myriad effects of this condition have been characterized, including glucose intolerance, resistance to antiviral therapy, progression of hepatic fibrosis, development of hepatocellular carcinoma, and general decrease in quality of life. Metabolic-related conditions and disorders, such as visceral obesity and diabetes mellitus, have been shown to synergistically enhance HCV-induced metabolic disturbance, and are associated with worse prognosis. Yet, the molecular interactions between HCV-induced metabolic disturbance and host-associated metabolic factors remain largely unknown. The diet and lifestyle recommendations for chronic hepatitis C are basically the same as those for obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Specifically, patients are suggested to restrict their dietary iron intake, abstain from alcohol and tobacco, and increase their intake of green tea and coffee (to attain the beneficial effects of caffeine and polyphenols). While successful clinical management of HCV-infected patients with metabolic disorders has also been achieved with some anti-diabetic (i.e., metformin) and anti-lipid (i.e., statins) medications, it is recommended that sulfonylurea and insulin be avoided.},

The authors used data from 8,071 black and white participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2006) who were aged 25 years or older to investigate whether black-white hypertension disparities varied by level of metropolitan-level racial residential segregation and whether this was explained by race differences in neighborhood poverty. Racial segregation was measured by using the black isolation index. After adjustment for demographics and individual-level socioeconomic position, blacks had 2.74 times higher odds of hypertension than whites (95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.32, 3.25). However, race differences were significantly smaller in low- than in high-segregation areas (P(interaction) = 0.006). Race differences in neighborhood poverty did not explain this heterogeneity, but poverty further modified race disparities: Race differences were largest in segregated, low-poverty areas (odds ratio = 4.14, 95\% CI: 3.18, 5.38) and smallest in nonsegregated, high-poverty areas (odds ratio = 1.24, 95\% CI: 0.77, 2.01). These findings suggest that racial disparities in hypertension are not invariant and are modified by contextual levels of racial segregation and neighborhood poverty, highlighting the role of environmental factors in the genesis of disparities.},

  abstract = {Background The current polio epidemiology in Pakistan poses a unique challenge for global eradication as the country is affected by ongoing endemic poliovirus transmission. Across the country, 40 union councils (UCs) which serve as core reservoirs for poliovirus with continuous incidences of polio cases are categorized as super-high-risk union councils (SHRUCs). Methodology A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 39 SHRUCs using a two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique. 6,976 children aged 12--23~months were covered. A structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Data were analyzed using STATA version 17. Results Based on both vaccination records and recall, 48.3\% of children were fully-, 35.4 \% were partially-, and 16.3\% were non-vaccinated in the SHRUC districts. A child is considered fully vaccinated when h/she completed vaccination for BCG, OPV0, OPV 1-3, Penta 1-3, PCV 1-3, IPV, and MCV1. Vaccination cards were seen for over half of the children in the SHRUC districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and the majority of the SHRUC districts in Sindh, except for the SHRUC district of Malir the districts of Balochistan. Results for polio vacancies show that 60.9\% of children from the SHRUC districts were vaccinated with at least three doses of OPV and one dose of IPV, while 20.4\% were vaccinated with any OPV doses or IPV and 18.7\% of children did not receive any polio vaccines. The dropout rate between vaccine visits was higher than the WHO-recommended cutoff point of 10\% for all vaccine doses in the SHRUC districts. The likelihood of being fully vaccinated was higher among the children of educated parents. Full vaccination was found significant among the children of any SHRUC districts compared to district Killa Abdullah. Conclusion Context-specific strategies with more focus on community engagement and targeted mobilization, along with robust monitoring mechanisms, would help address the underlying challenges of under-immunization in the SHRUCs.},

  abstract = {Estimating recent effective population size is of great importance in characterizing and predicting the evolution of natural populations. Methods based on nucleotide diversity may underestimate current day effective population sizes due to historical bottlenecks, whereas methods that reconstruct demographic history typically only detect long-term variations. However, soft selective sweeps, which leave a fingerprint of mutational history by recurrent mutations on independent haplotype backgrounds, holds promise of an estimate more representative of recent population history. Here, we present a simple and robust method of estimation based only on knowledge of the number of independent recurrent origins and the current frequency of the beneficial allele in a population sample, independent of the strength of selection and age of the mutation. Using a forward-time theoretical framework, we show the mean number of origins is a function of h {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2Nl and current allele frequency, through a simple equation, and the distribution is approximately Poisson. This estimate is robust to whether mutants preexisted before selection arose and is equally accurate for diploid populations with incomplete dominance. For fast (e.g., seasonal) demographic changes compared with time scale for fixation of the mutant allele, and for moderate peak-to-trough ratios, we show our constant population size estimate can be used to bound the maximum and minimum population size. Applied to the Vgsc gene of Anopheles gambiae, we estimate an effective population size of roughly 6 \^A 107, and including seasonal demographic oscillations, a minimum effective population size {$>$}3 \^A 107, and a maximum {$<$}6 \^A 109, suggesting a mean \$109.},

Many strategies have been developed to reduce aflatoxin or its adverse effects in the body. However, a question that has been under-addressed is how likely these strategies will be adopted in the countries that need them most to improve public health. This study evaluates two aspects crucial to the adoption of new technologies and methods: the costs and the efficacy of different strategies. First, different aflatoxin risk-reduction strategies are described and categorized into pre-harvest, post-harvest, dietary, and clinical settings. Relevant data on the costs and efficacy of each strategy, in reducing either aflatoxin in food or its metabolites in the body are then compiled and discussed. In addition, we describe which crops are affected by each intervention, who is likely to pay for the control strategy, and who is likely to benefit. A framework is described for how to evaluate cost-effectiveness of strategies according to World Health Organization (WHO) standards. Finally, it is discussed which strategies are likely to be cost-effective and helpful under different conditions worldwide of regulations, local produce and soil ecology, and potential health emergencies.},

According to recent reports it is still a cause for concern. VC has been found as a degradation product of chloroethylene solvents (perchloroethylene and trichloroethylene) and in landfill gas and groundwater at concentrations up to 200 mg/m(3) and 10 mg/L, respectively. Worldwide occupational exposure to VC still seems to be high in some countries (e.g., averages of approximately 1,300 mg/m(3) until 1987 in one factory), and exposure may also be high in others where VC is not regulated. By combining the most relevant epidemiologic studies from several countries, we observed a 5-fold excess of liver cancer, primarily because of a 45-fold excess risk from angiosarcoma of the liver (ASL). The number of ASL cases reported up to the end of 1998 was 197 worldwide. The average latency for ASL is 22 years. Some studies show a small excess risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, and others suggest a possible risk of brain tumors among highly exposed workers. Lung cancer, lymphomas, or leukemia do not seem to be related to VC exposure according to recent results. The mutation spectra observed in rat and human liver tumors (ASL and/or hepatocellular carcinoma) that are associated with exposure to VC are clearly distinct from those observed in sporadic liver tumors or hepatic tumors that are associated with other exposures. In rats, the substitution mutations found at A:T base pairs in the ras and p53 genes are consistent with the promutagenic properties of the DNA adduct 1,N(6)-ethenoadenine formed from VC metabolites. Risk assessments derived from animal studies seem to overestimate the actual risk of cancer when comparing estimated and reported cases of ASL.},

In experiment I, hepatocytes were flow-seeded onto PGA scaffolds and cultured in a flow perfusion system for 24 h. Overall metabolic activity and distribution of cells were assessed by their ability to reduce MTT. DNA quantification was used to determine the number of cells attached. Culture medium was analyzed for albumin content. In Experiment II, hepatocyte/polymer constructs were cultured in a perfusion system for 2 and 7 days. The constructs were examined by SEM and histology. Culture medium was analyzed for albumin. In experiment I, an average of 4.4 X 10(6) cells attached to the scaffolds by DNA quantification. Cells maintained a high metabolic activity and secreted albumin at a rate of 13 pg/cell/day. In experiment II, SEM demonstrated successful attachment of hepatocytes on the scaffolds after 2 and 7 days. Cells appeared healthy on histology and maintained a high rate of albumin secretion through day 7. Hepatocytes can be dynamically seeded onto biodegradable polymers and survive with a high rate of albumin synthesis in the flow perfusion culture system.},

  abstract = {The United States is in the midst of a prolonged and growing epidemic of accidental and preventable deaths associated with overdoses of licit and illicit opioids. For more than 3 decades, naloxone has been used by emergency medical personnel to pharmacologically reverse overdoses. The peers or family members of overdose victims, however, are most often the actual first responders and are best positioned to intervene within an hour of the onset of overdose symptoms. Data from recent pilot programs demonstrate that lay persons are consistently successful in safely administering naloxone and reversing opioid overdose. Current evidence supports the extensive scaleup of access to naloxone. We present advantages and limitations associated with a range of possible policy and program responses.},

  abstract = {Primary hepatocytes are commonly used as liver surrogates in toxicology and tissue engineering fields, therefore, maintenance of functional hepatocytes in vitro is an important topic of investigation. This paper sought to characterize heparin-based hydrogel as a three-dimensional scaffold for hepatocyte culture. The primary rat hepatocytes were mixed with a prepolymer solution comprised of thiolated heparin and acrylated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Raising the temperature from 25 degrees to 37 degrees C initiated Michael addition reaction between the thiol and acrylated moieties and resulted in formation of hydrogel with entrapped cells. Analysis of liver-specific products, albumin and urea, revealed that the heparin hydrogel was non-cytotoxic to cells and, in fact, promoted hepatic function. Hepatocytes entrapped in the heparin-based hydrogel maintained high levels of albumin and urea synthesis after three weeks in culture. Because heparin is known to bind growth factors, we incorporated hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-an important liver signaling molecule - into the hydrogel. HGF release from heparin hydrogel matrix was analyzed using enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) and was shown to occur in a controlled manner with only 40\% of GF molecules released after 30 days in culture. Importantly, hepatocytes cultured within HGF-containing hydrogels exhibited significantly higher levels of albumin and urea synthesis compared to cells cultured in the hydrogel alone. Overall, heparin-based hydrogel showed to be a promising matrix for encapsulation and maintenance of difficult-to-culture primary hepatocytes. In the future, we envision employing heparin-based hyrogels as matrices for in vitro differentiation of hepatocytes or stem cells and as vehicles for transplantation of these cells.},

The R package pomp provides a very flexible framework for Monte Carlo statistical investigations using nonlinear, non-Gaussian POMP models. A range of modern statistical methods for POMP models have been implemented in this framework including sequential Monte Carlo, iterated filtering, particle Markov chain Monte Carlo, approximate Bayesian computation, maximum synthetic likelihood estimation, nonlinear forecasting, and trajectory matching. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of these methodologies using some simple toy problems. We also illustrate the specification of more complex POMP models, using a nonlinear epidemiological model with a discrete population, seasonality, and extra-demographic stochasticity. We discuss the specification of user-defined models and the development of additional methods within the programming environment provided by pomp.},

This means that a person with antibodies well tuned to an initial infection will not be protected against the same virus years later and that vaccine-mediated protection will decay. To expand our understanding of which endemic human viruses evolve in this fashion, we assess adaptive evolution across the genome of 28 endemic viruses spanning a wide range of viral families and transmission modes. Surface proteins consistently show the highest rates of adaptation, and ten viruses in this panel are estimated to undergo antigenic evolution to selectively fix mutations that enable the escape of prior immunity. Thus, antibody evasion is not an uncommon evolutionary strategy among human viruses, and monitoring this evolution will inform future vaccine efforts. Additionally, by comparing overall amino acid substitution rates, we show that SARS-CoV2 is accumulating protein-coding changes at substantially faster rates than endemic viruses.},

Lack of pediatric prophylaxis guidelines results in variation in preventative antibiotic regimens.We performed a retrospective observational study of LT recipients \&lt;18 years old using a merged data set that included data from the Pediatric Health Information System and the United Network for Organ Sharing between 2006 and 2017. The exposure was defined as the antibiotic(s) received within 24\>hours of LT, with 6 categories, ranging from narrow (category 1: cefazolin), to broad). The primary outcome was presence or absence of SSI in the index admission. Mixed-effects logistic regression compared the effectiveness of each category in preventing SSI, relative to category 1.Of the 2586 LT, 284 (11\%) met SSI criteria. The SSI rate was higher in the younger subcohort (16.2\%) than in the older (8.6\%), necessitating a stratified analysis. Antibiotics from category 5 were most commonly used. In the younger subcohort, the adjusted risk was increased in all categories compared with the reference, most notably in category 3 (odds ratio [OR], 2.58 [95\% confidence interval: .69--9.59]) and category 6 (2.76 [.66--11.56]). In the older subcohort, estimated ORs were also increased for each category, most notably in category 4 (2.49 [95\% confidence interval: .99--6.27]). None of the ORs suggested benefit from broader-spectrum prophylaxis. Our E-value assessment suggests that it's unlikely there is unmeasured confounding by indication to the degree necessary to revert ORs to protective.There was wide variation in antibiotic prophylaxis. Adjusted analyses did not reveal a protective benefit of broader-spectrum prophylaxis in either subcohort, suggesting that narrower regimens may be adequate.},

Much ink has been spilled debating whether these changes in travel behavior are due to changing preferences or economic circumstances. In this paper, we use eight waves of data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to examine recent changes in auto ownership among US families with a particular focus on Millennials. We find that today's young adults do own fewer cars than previous generations did when they were young. However, when we control for whether young adults have become economically independent from their parents, i.e. left the nest, we find that economically independent young adults own slightly more cars than we would expect, given their low incomes and wealth. We caution planners to temper their enthusiasm about ``peak car,'' as this may largely be a manifestation of economic factors that could reverse in coming years.},

METHOD: We evaluated the association between smoking and risk of HCC in the Singapore Chinese Health Study, a prospective cohort with a low prevalence of alcohol intake. Information on cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption was obtained through in-person interviews conducted at enrolment. RESULTS: After a mean of 11.5 years of follow-up, there were 394 incident cases of HCC. Participants who consumed more than two alcoholic drinks per day showed an increased risk for HCC (hazard ratio (HR)=2.24; 95\% confidence interval (CI)=1.46-3.41). After adjusting for alcohol consumption and other potential confounders, current vs never smokers had a statistically significant, increased risk of HCC (HR=1.63; 95\% CI=1.27-2.10) that was dose-dependent (number of cigarettes per day, P for trend{$<$}0.001). The observed tobacco-HCC association also was duration-dependent (years of smoking in ever smokers, P for trend=0.002). When we excluded daily drinkers from the analysis, all risk estimates remained essentially the same and statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Our findings strongly implicate tobacco smoke as a causal factor of HCC development.},

The World Health Organization recommended the integration of the HB vaccine into the national immunisation programs in all countries. HBV prevention strategies are classified into three groups: (1) universal vaccination alone; (2) universal vaccination with screening of pregnant women plus HB immune globulin (HBIG) at birth; and (3) selective vaccination with screening of pregnant women plus HBIG at birth. Most low-income countries have adopted universal vaccine programs without screening of pregnant women. However, HB vaccines are not widely used in low-income countries. The Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunization was launched in 2000, and by 2012, the global coverage of a three-dose HB vaccine had increased to 79\%. The next challenges are to further increase the coverage rate, close the gap between recommendations and routine practices, approach high-risk individuals, screen and treat chronically infected individuals, and prevent breakthrough infections. To eradicate HBV infections, strenuous efforts are required to overcome socioeconomic barriers to the HB vaccine; this task is expected to take several decades to complete.},

It has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The outbreak emerged in a region of chronic conflict and insecurity, and directed attacks against health care workers may have interfered with disease response activities. Our study characterizes and quantifies the broader conflict dynamics over the course of the outbreak by pairing epidemiological and all available spatial conflict data. Methods: We build a set of conflict variables by mapping the spatial locations of all conflict events and their associated deaths in each of the affected health zones in North Kivu and Ituri, eastern DRC, before and during the outbreak. Using these data, we compare patterns of conflict before and during the outbreak in affected health zones and those not affected. We then test whether conflict is correlated with increased EVD transmission at the health zone level. Findings: The incidence of conflict events per capita is \textasciitilde{} 600 times more likely in Ituri and North Kivu than for the rest of the DRC. We identified 15 time periods of substantial uninterrupted transmission across 11 health zones and a total of 120 bi-weeks. We do not find significant short-term associations between the bi-week reproduction numbers and the number of conflicts. However, we do find that the incidence of conflict per capita was correlated with the incidence of EVD per capita at the health zone level for the entire outbreak (Pearson's r = 0.33, 95\% CI 0.05--0.57). In the two provinces, the monthly number of conflict events also increased by a factor of 2.7 in Ebolaaffected health zones (p value {$<$} 0.05) compared to 2.0 where no transmission was reported and 1.3 in the rest of the DRC, in the period between February 2019 and July 2019.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Racial residential segregation is hypothesized to affect population health by systematically patterning health-relevant exposures and opportunities according to individuals' race or income. Growing interest into the association between residential segregation and health disparities demands more rigorous appraisal of commonly used measures of segregation. Most current studies rely on census tracts as approximations of the local residential environment when calculating segregation indices of either neighborhoods or metropolitan areas. Because census tracts are arbitrary in size and shape, reliance on this geographic scale limits understanding of place-health associations. More flexible, explicitly spatial derivations of traditional segregation indices have been proposed but have not been compared with tract-derived measures in the context of health disparities studies common to social epidemiology, health demography, or medical geography. We compared segregation measured with tract-derived as well as GIS surface-density-derived indices. Measures were compared by region and population size, and segregation measures were linked to birth record to estimate the difference in association between segregation and very preterm birth. Separate analyses focus on metropolitan segregation and on neighborhood segregation. RESULTS: Across 231 metropolitan areas, tract-derived and surface-density-derived segregation measures are highly correlated. However overall correlation obscures important differences by region and metropolitan size. In general the discrepancy between measure types is greatest for small metropolitan areas, declining with increasing population size. Discrepancies in measures are greatest in the South, and smallest in Western metropolitan areas. Choice of segregation index changed the magnitude of the measured association between segregation and very preterm birth. For example among black women, the risk ratio for very preterm birth in metropolitan areas changed from 2.12 to 1.68 for the effect of high versus low segregation when using surface-density-derived versus tract-derived segregation indices. Variation in effect size was smaller but still present in analyses of neighborhood racial composition and very preterm birth in Atlanta neighborhoods. CONCLUSION: Census tract-derived measures of segregation are highly correlated with recently introduced spatial segregation measures, but the residual differences among measures are not uniform for all areas. Use of surface-density-derived measures provides researchers with tools to further explore the spatial relationships between segregation and health disparities.},

Epidemiologic differences between very preterm ({$<$}32 weeks gestation) and moderately preterm births (32-36 weeks) raise questions about whether this association is similar across gestational ages, and through what pathways it might be mediated. Hierarchical Bayesian models were fit to answer three questions: is the isolation-prematurity association similar for very and moderately preterm birth; is this association mediated by maternal chronic disease, socioeconomic status, or metropolitan area crime and poverty rates; and how much of the geographic variation in Black-White very preterm birth disparities is explained by isolation segregation? Singleton births to Black and White women in 231 U.S. metropolitan statistical areas in 2000-2002 were analyzed and isolation segregation was calculated for each. We found that among Black women, isolation is associated with very preterm birth and moderately preterm birth. The association may be partially mediated by individual level socioeconomic characteristics and metropolitan level violent crime rates. There is no association between segregation and prematurity among White women. Isolation segregation explains 28\% of the geographic variation in Black-White very preterm birth disparities. Our findings highlight the importance of isolation segregation for the high-burden outcome of very preterm birth, but unexplained excess risk for prematurity among Black women is substantial. \copyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Integration of transcriptome and metabolome data revealed tight relationships between the changes at these two levels. Transcriptome as well as metabolite changes reflected a major investment in two processes: adaptation from fully respiratory to respiro-fermentative metabolism and preparation for growth acceleration. At the metabolite level, a severe drop of the AXP pools directly after glucose addition was not accompanied by any of the other three NXP. To counterbalance this loss, purine biosynthesis and salvage pathways were transcriptionally upregulated in a concerted manner, reflecting a sudden increase of the purine demand. The short-term dynamics of the transcriptome revealed a remarkably fast decrease in the average half-life of downregulated genes. This acceleration of mRNA decay can be interpreted both as an additional nucleotide salvage pathway and an additional level of glucose-induced regulation of gene expression.},

Currently, both scientific literature and government documents exhibit important disagreements, confused terminology, and considerable, if not deliberate, vagueness about the meaning of the phrase 'cancer disparities' and the related term 'social disparities in health.' This article accordingly reviews critical issues relevant to cohering understanding of what is meant by 'cancer disparities;' offers a definition premised on the causal contention that social disparities in health, by definition, arise from social inequity; and considers its implications for developing a multidisciplinary research agenda on social inequalities in cancer. Tackling this issue will require rigorous and critical frameworks, questions, and methods derived from multiple disciplines, and will necessarily involve epidemiologic, clinical, and intervention research, both quantitative and qualitative. At issue is making conscious research choices: about which types of disparities we study, in relation to which aspect of cancer, so as to improve the likelihood our research will help inform a society-wide discourse about the extent, origins of, and remedies for social injustices in cancer, thereby aiding efforts to eliminate social inequalities in health.},

We focused on breast cancer estrogen receptor (ER) status, a biomarker associated with survival and, etiologically, with social and economic privilege. Methods: We obtained data from the 13 registry group of US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program for 1992--2012 on all women aged 25--84 who were diagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer (n~=~516,382). We appended to each case's record her annual county median household income quintile and the quintile for her annual county value for ICE measures for income ({$\leq$}20th vs.~{$\geq$}80th household income quintile), race/ethnicity (black vs. white), and income plus race/ethnicity (low-income black vs. high-income white). The odds of being ER+ versus ER- were estimated in relation to the county-level income and ICE measures, adjusting for relevant covariates. Results: Women in the most privileged versus deprived county quintile for household income and for all three ICE measures had a 1.1- to 1.3-fold increased odds (95~\% confidence intervals excluding 1) of having an ER+ tumor. These results were robust to adjustment for age at diagnosis, cancer registry, tumor characteristics (tumor stage, size, histology, grade), and race/ethnicity. Conclusion: A focus on segregation offers news possibilities for understanding how inequitable group relations contribute to cancer inequities. The utility of employing the ICE for monitoring cancer inequities should be investigated in relation to other cancer outcomes.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between August 9, 2005, and April 3, 2006, we interviewed 84 patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndromes at Grady Memorial Hospital in downtown Atlanta, GA, and contacted them by telephone about 2 weeks later. English-speaking patients who managed their own medications were studied. Patients reported their adherence with filling prescriptions and taking medications after discharge, as well as barriers to and potential enablers of proper medication use. RESULTS: Most of the 84 respondents were African American (74 [88\%]), male (49 [58\%]), and middle-aged (mean age, 54.5 years). Only 40\% of patients filled their prescriptions on the day of discharge, 20\% filled them 1 or 2 days later, and 18\% waited 3 to 9 days; 22\% had not filled their prescriptions by the time of the follow-up telephone call (median, 12 days; interquartile range, 8-18 days). Transportation, cost, and wait times at the pharmacy were cited as the main barriers. Many patients reported it was somewhat or very difficult to understand why they were prescribed medications (21\%), how to take them (11\%), or how to reconcile them with the medications they had been taking before hospitalization (16\%). About half the patients (40 [48\%]) reported some degree of nonadherence after discharge. Patients noted that several forms of assistance could improve medication use after discharge, including lower medication costs (75\%), a follow-up telephone call (68\%), transportation to the pharmacy (65\%), pharmacist counseling before discharge (64\%), and a pillbox (56\%). CONCLUSION: Patients often delay filling prescriptions and have difficulty understanding medication regimens after hospital discharge. Interventions that reduce medication costs, facilitate transportation, improve medication counseling, and supply such organizing aids as pillboxes might be beneficial.},

The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by UV-Vis spectrophotometer, HR-TEM, particle size analyser and zeta potential measurement. Toxicity studies of H-AuNPs in zebra fish confirmed the in vivo safety of the AuNPs. The in vitro cytotoxicity results showed that the amount of MET-H-AuNPs enough to achieve 50\% inhibition (IC50) was much lower than free MET. Flow cytometry analysis showed the significant reduction in G2/M phase after treatment with MET-H-AuNPs, and molecular level apoptosis were studied using western blotting. The novelty of this study is the successful synthesis of AuNPs with a higher MET loading and this formulation exhibited better targeted delivery as well as increased regression activity than free MET in HepG2 cells.},

Coded sera were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) by third-generation enzyme immunoassays, and information on smoking habits and beverage consumption was obtained. We found a significant dose-response, positive association between smoking and HCC risk [{$>$}/= 2 packs per day, odds ratio (OR)=2.5]. This association was stronger in individuals without chronic infection with either HBV or HCV ({$>$}/= 2 packs per day, OR=2.8). Consumption of alcoholic beverages above a threshold of 40 glasses per week increased the risk of HCC (OR=1.9). We also found evidence of a strong, statistically significant and apparently super-multiplicative effect of heavy smoking and heavy drinking in the development of HCC (OR for both exposures=9.6). This interaction was particularly evident among individuals without either HBsAg or anti-HCV (OR for both exposures=10.9). Coffee intake was not positively associated with HCC risk, but the reverse could not be excluded for the subgroup of chronically infected individuals. In conclusion, tobacco smoking and heavy alcohol consumption are associated with increased risk of HCC, especially when these 2 exposures occur together.},

While popular methods to analyze sequence data often involve phylogenetic tree inference, they are vulnerable to errors from recombination and impose a high computational cost, making it difficult to obtain real-time results when the number of sequences is in or above the thousands. Here, we propose an alternative strategy to outbreak detection using genomic data based on deep learning methods developed for image classification. The key idea is to use a pairwise genetic distance matrix calculated from viral sequences as an image, and develop convolutional neutral network (CNN) models to classify areas of the images that show signatures of active outbreak, leading to identification of subsets of sequences taken from an active outbreak. We showed that our method is efficient in finding HIV-1 outbreaks with R0 {$\geq$} 2.5, and overall a specificity exceeding 98\% and sensitivity better than 92\%. We validated our approach using data from HIV-1 CRF01 in Europe, containing both endemic sequences and a well-known dual outbreak in intravenous drug users. Our model accurately identified known outbreak sequences in the background of slower spreading HIV. Importantly, we detected both outbreaks early on, before they were over, implying that had this method been applied in real-time as data became available, one would have been able to intervene and possibly prevent the extent of these outbreaks. This approach is scalable to processing hundreds of thousands of sequences, making it useful for current and future real-time epidemiological investigations, including public health monitoring using large databases and especially for rapid outbreak identification.},

It argues for the need to expand our analytical focus from static residential spaces to other relevant places and times inpeople's everyday lives.Mobility is anessential element of people's spatiotemporal experiences, and these complex experiences cannot be fully understood by just looking at where people live. As many social scientists are interested in studying segregation, environmental exposure, and accessibility, geographers can contribute to advancing temporally integrated analysis of these issues through careful examination of people's everyday experiences as their lives unfold in space and time. Interdisciplinary research along this line could have a broad impact on many disciplines beyond geography.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Geographic access, including mode of transportation, to health care facilities remains understudied. OBJECTIVE: To identify sociodemographic factors associated with public vs private transportation use to access health care and identify the respondent, trip, and community factors associated with longer distance and time traveled for health care visits. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used data from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey, including 16\,760 trips or a nationally weighted estimate of 5\,550\,527\,364 trips to seek care in the United States. Households that completed the recruitment and retrieval survey for all members aged 5 years and older were included. Data were analyzed between June and August 2022. EXPOSURES: Mode of transportation (private vs public transportation) used to seek care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Survey-weighted multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with public vs private transportation and self-reported distance and travel time. Then, for each income category, an interaction term of race and ethnicity with type of transportation was used to estimate the specific increase in travel burden associated with using public transportation compared a private vehicle for each race category. RESULTS: The sample included 12\,092 households and 15\,063 respondents (8500 respondents [56.4\%] aged 51-75 years; 8930 [59.3\%] females) who had trips for medical care, of whom 1028 respondents (6.9\%) were Hispanic, 1164 respondents (7.8\%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 11\,957 respondents (79.7\%) were non-Hispanic White. Factors associated with public transportation use included non-Hispanic Black race (compared with non-Hispanic White: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.54 [95\% CI, 1.90-6.61]; P\,{$<$}\,.001) and household income less than \$25\,000 (compared with {$\geq\$$}100\,000: aOR, 7.16 [95\% CI, 3.50-14.68]; P\,{$<$}\,.001). The additional travel time associated with use of public transportation compared with private vehicle use varied by race and household income, with non-Hispanic Black respondents with income of \$25\,000 to \$49\,999 experiencing higher burden associated with public transportation (mean difference, 81.9 [95\% CI, 48.5-115.3] minutes) than non-Hispanic White respondents with similar income (mean difference, 25.5 [95\% CI, 17.5-33.5] minutes; P\,{$<$}\,.001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that certain racial, ethnic, and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations rely on public transportation to seek health care and that reducing delays associated with public transportation could improve care for these patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Five times more Vietnamese-American women develop cervical cancer than white women. Few studies have examined whether community-based participatory research can effectively address Asian immigrants' health problems. This article reports the preliminary evaluation of 1 such project. METHODS: A coalition of 11 organizations in Santa Clara County, California worked with university researchers to design and simultaneously implement a media education (ME) campaign and a lay health worker outreach (LHWO) program to increase Vietnamese-American women's cervical cancer awareness, knowledge, and screening. Two agencies each recruited 10 lay health workers (LHWs), who, in turn, each recruited 20 women who were then randomized into 2 groups: 10 to LHWO+ME (n = 200) and 10 to ME alone (n = 200). LHWs organized meetings with women to increase their knowledge and to motivate them to obtain Pap tests. Participants completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires. RESULTS: At post-intervention, significantly more LHWO+ME women understood that human papillomavirus and smoking cause cervical cancer. The number of women who had obtained a Pap test increased significantly among women in both LHWO+ME and ME groups, but substantially more in the LHWO+ME group. Significantly more LHWO+ME women said they intended to have a Pap test. CONCLUSIONS: Media education campaigns can increase Vietnamese women's awareness of the importance of Pap tests, but lay health workers are more effective at encouraging women to actually obtain the tests. Lay health workers are effective because they use their cultural knowledge and social networks to create change. Researchers, community members, and community-based organizations can share expert knowledge and skills, and build one another's capacities.},

Methods We searched all years of PubMed (through May 2016) using these terms: racial segregation, residential segregation, neighborhood racial composition (first terms) and (second terms) cancer incidence, mortality, survival, stage at diagnosis, screening. The 17 (of 668) articles that measured both segregation and a cancer outcome were retained. Results Segregation contributed significantly to cancer and to racial cancer disparities in 70\% of analyses, even after con-trolling for socioeconomic status and health insurance. Residing in segregated African-American areas was associat-ed with higher odds of later-stage diagnosis of breast and lung cancers, higher mortality rates and lower survival rates from breast and lung cancers, and higher cumulative cancer risks associated with exposure to ambient air toxics. There were no studies of many types of cancer (e.g., cervical). Studies differed in their measure of segregation, and 40\% used an invalid measure. Possible mediators of the segregation effect usually were not tested. Conclusions Empirical analysis of segregation and racial can-cer disparities is a recent area of research. The literature is limited to 17 studies that focused primarily on breast cancer. Studies differed in their measure of segregation, yet segrega-tion nonetheless contributed to cancer and to racial cancer disparities in 70\% of analyses. This suggests the need for further research that uses valid measures of segregation, ex-amines a variety of types of cancers, and explores the variables that may mediate the segregation effect.},

We review evidence that Black neighborhoods have significantly poorer healthcare facilities staffed by less competent physicians, higher environmental exposures, and poorer built environments than do White neighborhoods, and we argue that these neighborhood disparities are 3 pathways through which segregation contributes to health disparities.

  abstract = {Background: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is a major obstacle for pandemic mitigation. As vaccine hesitancy occurs along multiple dimensions, we used a social-ecological framework to guide the examination of COVID-19 vaccine intentions. Methods: Using an online survey in the US conducted in July 2020, we examined intentions to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine, once available. 592 respondents provided data, including measures of demographics, vaccine history, social norms, perceived risk, and trust in sources of COVID-19 information. Bivariate and multivariate multinomial models were used to compare respondents who intended to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to respondents who did not intend or were ambivalent about COVID-19 vaccination. Results: Only 59.1\% of the sample reported that they intended to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine. In the multivariate multinomial model, those respondents who did not intend to be vaccinated, as compared to those who did, had significantly lower levels of trust in the CDC as a source of COVID-19 information (aOR = 0.29, CI = 0.17--0.50), reported lower social norms of COVID-19 preventive behaviors (aOR = 0.67, CI 0.51--0.88), scored higher on COVID-19 Skepticism (aOR = 1.44, CI = 1.28--1.61), identified as more politically conservative (aOR = 1.23, CI = 1.05--1.45), were less likely to have obtained a flu vaccine in the prior year (aOR = 0.21, CI = 0.11--0.39), were less likely to be female (aOR = 0.51, CI = 0.29--0. 87), and were much more likely to be Black compared to White (aOR = 10.70, CI = 4.09--28.1). A highly similar pattern was observed among those who were ambivalent about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine compared to those who intended to receive one. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest several avenues for COVID-19 vaccine promotion campaigns, including social network diffusion strategies and cross-partisan messaging, to promote vaccine trust. The racial and gender differences in vaccine intentions also suggest the need to tailor campaigns based on gender and race.},

  abstract = {Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious global health problem, with 2 billion people infected worldwide, and 350 million suffering from chronic HBV infection. The 10th leading cause of death worldwide, HBV infections result in 500 000 to 1.2 million deaths per year caused by chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma; the last accounts for 320 000 deaths per year [1, 2]. In Western countries, the disease is relatively rare and acquired primarily in adulthood, whereas in Asia and most of Africa, chronic HBV infection is common and usually acquired perinatally or in childhood. More efficacious treatments, mass immunization programs, and safe injection techniques are essential for eliminating HBV infection and reducing global HBV-related morbidity and mortality. Safe and effective vaccines against HBV infection have been available since 1982. The implementation of mass immunization programs, which have been recommended by the World Health Organization since 1991, have dramatically decreased the incidence of HBV infection among infants, children, and adolescents in many countries [2]. However, not all countries have adopted these recommendations and there remains a large number of persons that were infected with HBV prior to the implementation of immunization programs. Antiviral treatment is the only way to reduce morbidity and mortality from chronic HBV infection. Conventional interferon alfa and lamivudine have been the primary treatments to date. Conventional interferon alfa produces a durable response in a moderate proportion of patients but has undesirable side-effects and must be administered subcutaneously three times per week. Lamivudine also produces a response in a modest proportion of patients and causes few side-effects [3].

Our method, NEUMA (Normalization by Expected Uniquely Mappable Area), is based on effective length normalization using uniquely mappable areas of gene and mRNA isoform models. Using the known transcriptome sequence model such as RefSeq, NEUMA pre-computes the numbers of all possible gene-wise and isoform-wise informative reads: the former being sequences mapped to all mRNA isoforms of a single gene exclusively and the latter uniquely mapped to a single mRNA isoform. The results are used to estimate the effective length of genes and transcripts, taking experimental distributions of fragment size into consideration. Quantitative RT-PCR based on 27 randomly selected genes in two human cell lines and computer simulation experiments demonstrated superior accuracy of NEUMA over other recently developed methods. NEUMA covers a large proportion of genes and mRNA isoforms and offers a measure of consistency ('consistency coefficient') for each gene between an independently measured gene-wise level and the sum of the isoform levels. NEUMA is applicable to both paired-end and single-end RNA-Seq data. We propose that NEUMA could make a standard method in quantifying gene transcript levels from RNA-Seq data.},

Tetronic-PCL-heparin for the preparation of heparinized polymeric micelle was synthesized by introducing PCL as a biodegradable linkage on Tetronic, following the conjugation of heparin. The mean diameter of the formed TCH micelle was around 114 nm and increases in the micelle size after single and dual drug loading were observed. Loading efficiencies of IMC and bFGF were 30.9\% and 70.5\%, respectively. In vitro dual drug release profiles from TCH micelles were investigated. IMC was more slowly released from dual drug-loaded micelle over 3 weeks as compared with single drug-loaded one. bFGF was released over 2 months in a controlled manner. Therefore, the release profile results support that TCH micelle could not only incorporate a hydrophobic drug into the core but also bind with bFGF to heparin that exists on its outer shell. The TCH micelle will have enhanced therapeutic effects on the target site which may be required the multi-function of drugs to use.},

TCH PMs were fabricated by a single emulsion and solvent evaporation method. The structural properties of TCH were confirmed by (1)H NMR, FT-IR and GPC. The contents of bound heparin were 0.44 micro g/micro g and the heparin activity by APTT assay was 43.6\% when compared to free heparin. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of TCH PMs was approximately 0.11 g/l. The diameter of TC micelle was approximately 25 nm and its size after conjugation of heparin was increased to 114 nm due to the heparin molecules on the shell of the micelle. The bFGF loading amount of TCH PMs was considerably higher than that of TC, caused by specific interactions between heparin and bFGF. In vitro study, bFGF was released from TCH PMs in a controlled manner over 2 months. The results demonstrated that TCH PMs become a novel candidate for the long-term delivery of various growth factors with heparin-binding domain in tissue engineering.},

Inhibition kinetics revealed that xylose was transported by both high- and low-affinity glucose transporters. Affinities of both glucose transporters for xylose were very low under high glucose condition but increased to a similar level to glucose under low glucose condition. The maximum rate of xylose transport increased by 85\%, while an overall maximum glucose transport rate decreased by 42\% under low glucose condition, indicating the presence of other transport system for sugars except for glucose. It was suggested that expression of the high-affinity transporter and increased affinity of glucose transporters for xylose under low glucose condition would provide a fermentation strategy for enhancing the productivity of xylitol by recombinant S. cerevisiae harboring the xylose reductase gene.},

There are formulae and tables for estimating sample sizes required to detect the main effects of treatment and the treatment by time interactions for those models. A formula is proposed to estimate the sample size required to detect an interaction between two binary variables in a factorial design with repeated measures of a continuous outcome. The formula is based, in part, on the fact that the variance of an interaction is fourfold that of the main effect. A simulation study examines the statistical power associated with the resulting sample sizes in a mixed-effects linear regression model with a random intercept. The simulation varies the magnitude (??) of the standardized main effects and interactions, the intraclass correlation coefficient (??), and the number (k) of repeated measures within-subject. The results of the simulation study verify that the sample size required to detect a 2??2 interaction in a mixed-effects linear regression model is fourfold that to detect a main effect of the same magnitude. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, control of their proliferation and differentiation into complex, viable 3D tissues is challenging. Here we examine the use of biodegradable polymer scaffolds for promoting hES cell growth and differentiation and formation of 3D structures. We show that complex structures with features of various committed embryonic tissues can be generated, in vitro, by using early differentiating hES cells and further inducing their differentiation in a supportive 3D environment such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/poly(L-lactic acid) polymer scaffolds. We found that hES cell differentiation and organization can be influenced by the scaffold and directed by growth factors such as retinoic acid, transforming growth factor beta, activin-A, or insulin-like growth factor. These growth factors induced differentiation into 3D structures with characteristics of developing neural tissues, cartilage, or liver, respectively. In addition, formation of a 3D vessel-like network was observed. When transplanted into severe combined immunodeficient mice, the constructs continue to express specific human proteins in defined differentiated structures and appear to recruit and anastamose with the host vasculature. This approach provides a unique culture system for addressing questions in cell and developmental biology, and provides a potential mechanism for creating viable human tissue structures for therapeutic applications.},

  abstract = {Several studies have indicated that primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) may be associated with increased risk of some cancers, but the results are controversial. We conducted a systematic review of studies to examine the association of PBC with cancer risk by meta-analysis. We searched the PubMed and EMBASE databases for English-language studies published before November 2011. Studies were included if they reported relative risk estimates with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) or related data for the association between PBC and cancer risk. Approximately 16,300 PBC patients from several countries were included in this analysis. Of the 3510 titles identified, 16 publications involving 17 studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with the general population, PBC patients had a significantly higher risk of overall cancer (pooled rate ratio [RR], 1.55; 95\% CI, 1.28-1.83) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (pooled RR, 18.80; 95\% CI, 10.81-26.79). For stomach and pancreas cancers, the results of one study that only examined male patients with PBC indicated that PBC patients had increased risk of stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer, whereas the results of other studies of mixed-sex patients showed no significant association. Therefore, despite inconsistent results, the meta-analysis could not be conducted for assessing the association. PBC was not significantly associated with increased risk of other cancers. Conclusion: The present systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate that PBC is closely associated with a greater risk of overall cancer and HCC, but not with other cancers. The data regarding the association between PBC and risks of several cancers need to be further confirmed in future studies. (HEPATOLOGY 2012).},

METHODS: Using data from 11 population-based tumor registries that participate in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the relationship between race and ethnicity and breast cancer stage, treatments, and mortality rates. The cohort of 124,934 women diagnosed as having a first primary invasive breast carcinoma between January 1, 1992, and December 31, 1998, included 97,999 non-Hispanic whites, 10,560 blacks, 322 American Indians, 8834 Asians and Pacific Islanders, and 7219 Hispanic whites. RESULTS: Relative to non-Hispanic whites, blacks, American Indians, Hawaiians, Indians and Pakistanis, Mexicans, South and Central Americans, and Puerto Ricans had 1.4- to 3.6-fold greater risks of presenting with stage IV breast cancer. Blacks, Mexicans, and Puerto Ricans were 20\% to 50\% more likely to receive or elect a first course of surgical and radiation treatment not meeting the 2000 National Comprehensive Cancer Network standards. In addition, blacks, American Indians, Hawaiians, Vietnamese, Mexicans, South and Central Americans, and Puerto Ricans had 20\% to 200\% greater risks of mortality after a breast cancer diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in breast cancer stage, treatments, and mortality rates are present by race and ethnicity. Breast cancer survival may be improved by targeting factors, particularly socioeconomic factors, that underlie these differences.},

Ethnical disparity in overall survival has been demonstrated for HCC patients in the United States (U.S.). We aimed to evaluate the contributors to this survival disparity. The SEER database was used to identify HCC patients from 2004 to 2012. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate overall survival by ethnicity and the contributors to ethnical survival disparity. A total of 33 062 patients were included: 15 986 Non-Hispanic Whites, 6535 Hispanic Whites, 4842 African Americans, and 5699 Asians. Compared to Non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans had worse survival (HR, 1.18; 95\%CI, 1.14-1.23), while Asians had a better survival (HR, 0.85; 95\%CI, 0.82-0.89), and Hispanic Whites had a similar survival (HR, 1.01; 95\%CI, 0.97-1.05). Multivariate Cox analysis identified that tumor presentation- and treatment-related factors significantly contributed to the ethnical survival disparity. Especially, tumor size was the most important contributor (HR, 1.11; 95\%CI, 1.07-1.16). There is no ethnical survival disparity in patients undergoing liver transplantation and sub-analysis of patients within the Milan criteria for liver transplantation demonstrated no significant survival disparity between African Americans and non-Hispanic Whites in transplantation adjustment analysis (HR, 1.23; 95\%CI, 1.11-1.35 in non-adjustment analysis to HR, 1.05; 95\%CI, 0.95-1.15 after adjustment). Finally, no important contributor to the superior overall survival in Asians was identified. In conclusion, poor tumor presentation at diagnosis, limited benefit from resection and restricted utilization of liver transplantation are important contributors to poorer survival of African Americans with HCC.}

SVLP-QDs show homogeneity in size ( approximately 24 nm), similarity in spectral properties to unencapsidated QDs, and considerable stability. When incubated with living cells, SVLP-QDs are shown to enter the cells by caveolar endocytosis, travel along the microtubules, and accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum. This process mimics the early infection steps of SV40. This is the first paradigm of imaging viral behaviors with encapsidated QDs in living cells. The method may provide a new alternative for various purposes, such as tracing viruses or viral components, targeted nanoparticle delivery, and probing of drug delivery.},

In the present study, we illustrated that the epicatechin isomers (+)-epicatechin and (-)-epicatechin concentration-dependently inhibited HCV replication at nontoxic concentrations by using in vitro cell-based HCV replicon and JFH-1 infectious systems. In addition to significantly suppressing virus-induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, our results revealed that the anti-HCV activity of the epicatechin isomers occurred through the down-regulation of COX-2. Furthermore, both the epicatechin isomers additively inhibited HCV replication in combination with either interferon-alpha or viral enzyme inhibitors [2'-C-methylcytidine (NM-107) or telaprevir]. They also had prominent anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the gene expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and inducible nitrite oxide synthase as well as the COX-2 in viral protein-expressing hepatoma Huh-7 cells. Collectively, (+)-epicatechin and (-)-epicatechin may serve as therapeutic supplements for treating HCV-related diseases.},

The promise of ABS is that it provides high coverage of residential homes using a nearly complete sampling frame based on the U.S. Postal Service Delivery Sequence File. Because the frame is based on addresses and not landline telephone numbers, cell phone only households are included in the frame in proportion to their penetration within the sampled geography. Additionally, telephone numbers and other sample frame indicators - such as geocoded information from Census block groups or commercial databases - can be appended to the frame, providing more information for sample stratification and targeted sample treatments. While ABS provides a sample frame with high coverage, it does present other issues and challenges for researchers - some methodological, others operational. This webinar will provide participants with background on the ABS frame and potential survey design considerations that accompany its use; highlight areas where research has been conducted and where it is needed; and, provide an initial assessment of potential best practices when using and ABS approach. The course draws upon both the growing body of research in this area and many of the operational lessons learned from utilizing ABS survey designs.},

This study aims to assess spatially continuous physical and social environments and to examine the impact of psychosocial stress on the complex interaction between children and obesogenic environments in three Eastern Alabama counties. The obesogenic environment is defined with particular physical, social, and economic characteristics, causing higher risk of being overweight or obese. Survey questionnaires were collected for 690 children in grades K-6 at six schools to measure children's weight, height, socio-demographics, and home locations. Physical activity, psychosocial stress, and family environment were further gathered from a subsample of children aged 8???13 (n??=??65) through extended surveys. GIS and statistical methods were used to assess multilevel environments at family, community, and school levels. The associations between children's physical activity, stress, weight, and physical and social environments were examined by a series of multi-level regression models. Of the sample, 42.3\% of the participants were measured as overweight or obese, much higher than the national rate of 31.8\%. High weight clusters were observed in a variety of block groups with diverse physical and social environments. Community physical and social environments exhibited inconsistent even opposite spatial patterns (r??=?????0.18; p??},

Per-variable tests for proportional hazards, accelerated failure time, and accelerated hazards are efficiently carried out with and without spatial correlation through Bayes factors. The resulting reduced, interpretable spatial models can fit significantly better than a standard additive Cox model with spatial frailties.},

Previous implementations of the metric used an interaction surface based on census tracts and the locations of their centroids.

This research explores the role of spatial representation in the SIP metric and identifies a suitable grid-based representation that allows for comparison between regions while retaining cost-effectiveness with respect to computational burden. We also report on findings from an extensive sensitivity analysis investigating the SIP metric's input parameters such as a travel flow congestion factor and the length of the allowable time budget for social activities. The results provide new insights on the role of the modifiable areal unit problem in the computation of time geographic measures of accessibility.},

This study adopts an improved gravity-based model to measure the racial/ethnic inequity in transit-based spatial accessibility to COVID-19 vaccination sites in the Chicago Metropolitan Area. The results show that Black-majority and Hispanic-majority neighborhoods have significantly lower transit-based spatial accessibility to COVID-19 vaccination sites compared to White-majority neighborhoods. This research concludes that minority-dominated inner-city neighborhoods, despite better public transit coverage, are still disadvantaged in terms of transit-based spatial accessibility to COVID-19 vaccination sites. This is probably due to their higher population densities, which increase the competition for the limited supply of COVID-19 vaccination sites within each catchment area.},

  abstract = {Population-level analyses often use average quantities to describe heterogeneous systems, particularly when variation does not arise from identifiable groups. A prominent example, central to our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the basic reproductive number, R(0), which is defined as the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population. Population estimates of R(0) can obscure considerable individual variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during the global emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by numerous 'superspreading events' in which certain individuals infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases. For diseases transmitted by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS or smallpox, individual variation is difficult to measure empirically, and thus its importance for outbreak dynamics has been unclear. Here we present an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of the influence of individual variation in infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted diseases, we show that the distribution of individual infectiousness around R(0) is often highly skewed. Model predictions accounting for this variation differ sharply from average-based approaches, with disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more explosive. Using these models, we explore implications for outbreak control, showing that individual-specific control measures outperform population-wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic improvements achieved through targeted control policies emphasize the need to identify predictive correlates of higher infectiousness. Our findings indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a rigorous definition for superspreading events and a method to predict their frequency.},

DESIGN: Using data for 276 metropolitan areas in the USA, residential segregation was defined as the extent to which people with different levels of income live in the same or different census tracts. Two segregation measures were used: the ratio of income inequality between household within tracts to the inequality in average income between tracts, and the Jargowsky Neighbourhood Sorting Index. MAIN RESULTS: Results suggest that segregation within urban areas is associated with an additional mortality burden. However, the association between income inequality and mortality in these metropolitan statistical areas was found to be independent of the degree of economic segregation between their constituent neighbourhoods. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the association between income inequality and mortality is not mediated by the effects of greater residential segregation.},

In order to support such dynamic changes, we propose to adopt Software Product Line techniques. In particular, we adopt a feature model and product line architecture to capture the variability among software fault tolerance strategies based on design diversity. We propose an infrastructure that supports the strategy changes at runtime through dynamic management of variability and is responsible for the dependable mediation logic between service clients and redundant services. The infrastructure has an autonomous controller (i.e. managing a loop of collection, analysis, planning and execution), which is responsible for monitoring the changes of (i) QoS level and (ii) user requirements and decides, in accordance with high-level policies, an appropriate fault tolerance strategy to be executed. Also, our solution allows the dynamic provision of redundant services by describing them in terms of semantics. Finally, we performed a proof of concept which indicates the feasibility of the proposed solution. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) exclusively packages two genomic ssRNAs initiated by a specific protein:RNA interaction between the RCNMV coat protein (CP) and the viral RNA origin of assembly (OAS) element. In the present work, an oligonucleotide mimic of the RCNMV OAS sequences is attached to Au nanoparticles as a recognition signal to initiate the virion-like assembly by RCNMV CP. Covalent linkage of the OAS to Au functions as a trigger for specific encapsidation and demonstrates that foreign cargo can be packaged into RCNMV virions.},

PLGA (80:20) and PLLA polymer films were e-beam irradiated at doses from 2.5 to 50 Mrad and the degradation of these films were studied by measuring the changes in their molecular weights, FTIR spectra, thermal and morphological properties. The dominant effect of e-beam irradiation on both PLGA and PLLA is chain scission. Chain scission occurs first through scission of the polymer main chain, followed by hydrogen abstraction. Chain scission, though responsible for the reduction in the average molecular weight, Tc, Tg and Tm of both polymers, encourages crystallization in PLGA. PLLA also undergoes chain scission upon irradiation but to a lesser degree compared to PLGA. The higher crystallinity of PLLA is the key factor in its greater stability to e-beam radiation compared to PLGA. A linear relationship is also established between the decrease in molecular weight with respect to radiation dose.},

Although standards of rigor exist for the data collection, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of qualitative data, no such standards exist for translation of translinguistic qualitative research. Therefore, a new methodology modeled after Brislin's transla- tion principles was utilized with 60 Latino participants experiencing side effects as a result of prostate cancer treat- ment. Interviews were conducted in Spanish, transcribed verbatim, and then translated by research staff. By adapting Brislin's process, a new methodology was developed that more accurately conveys the true meaning of the partici- pant's experience, is more appropriate and meaningful, and opens doors to researchers interested in conducting research in a language other than their own, while at the same time ensuring the reliability and validity of study data.},

Tumor development was preceded by chronic liver disease resembling human nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Antioxidant treatment and genetic ablation of FADD demonstrated that death receptor-mediated and oxidative stress-dependent death of NEMO-deficient hepatocytes triggered disease pathogenesis in this model. These results reveal that NEMO-mediated NF-{$\kappa$}B activation in hepatocytes has an essential physiological function to prevent the spontaneous development of steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma, identifying NEMO as a tumor suppressor in the liver. \copyright{} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Based on the 2000 Census and primary care physician data, this research assesses the variation of spatial accessibility to primary care in the Chicago region, and analyzes the sensitivity of results by experimenting with ranges of threshold travel times in the floating catchment area method and travel friction coefficients in the gravity model.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the United States, Black infants have significantly worse birth outcomes than do White infants. The cause of these persisting racial disparities remains unexplained. Most extant studies focus on differential exposures to protective and risk factors during pregnancy, such as current socioeconomic status, maternal risky behaviors, prenatal care, psychosocial stress, or perinatal infections. These risk factors during pregnancy, however, do not adequately account for the disparities. METHODS: We conducted a literature review for longitudinal models of health disparities, and presented a synthesis of two leading models, using a life-course perspective. Traditional risk factors during pregnancy are then reexamined within their life-course context. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations and implications of the life-course perspective for future research, practice, and policy development. RESULTS: Two leading longitudinal models of health disparities were identified and discussed. The early programming model posits that exposures in early life could influence future reproductive potential. The cumulative pathways model conceptualizes decline in reproductive health resulting from cumulative wear and tear to the body's allostatic systems. We propose a synthesis of these two models, using the life-course perspective. Disparities in birth outcomes are the consequences of differential developmental trajectories set forth by early life experiences and cumulative allostatic load over the life course. CONCLUSIONS: Future research on racial disparities in birth outcomes needs to examine differential exposures to risk and protective factors not only during pregnancy, but over the life course of women. Eliminating disparities requires interventions and policy development that are more longitudinally and contextually integrated than currently prevail.},

  abstract = {Removal of the spleen had already been established as a routine technique to treat splenic trauma and other diseases affecting the spleen before the anatomy, physiology, and function of the spleen were known in the mid-twentieth century. It is now widely accepted that the splenectomized individual is at increased risk for infection, in particular, overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI). OPSI is a syndrome of fulminant sepsis occurring in splenectomized (asplenic) or hyposplenic individuals that is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Poorly opsonized bacteria such as encapsulated bacteria, in particular, Streptococcus pneumoniae, are often implicated in sepsis. The spleen is a reticuloendothelial organ that facilitates opsonization and phagocytosis of pathogens, in addition to cellular maintenance. Splenectomy is associated with an impairment in immunoglobulin production, antibody-mediated clearance, and phagocytosis, leading to an increased risk of infection and sepsis. Early identification of the at-risk patient, early blood cultures prior to antibiotic administration, urgent blood smears and fast pathogen-detection tests, and sepsis bundles should be utilized in these patients. Prompt management and aggressive treatment can alter the course of disease in the at-risk splenectomized patient. Overwhelming postsplenectomy infection can be prevented through vaccination, chemoprophylaxis, and patient education. This article evaluates post-splenectomy sepsis by summarizing the anatomy and function of the spleen, physiological changes after splenectomy that predispose the splenectomized patient to infection, and current management and prevention strategies.},

RESULTS: HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus prevalences were 1.8\%, 20.2\%, and 23.1\%, respectively. Infections were significantly associated with injection drug use (odds ratio = 10.1, 7.9, and 32.4). Incidence per 100 person-years was 0 for HIV, 2.7 for HBV, and 0.4 for HCV. CONCLUSIONS: High infection prevalence among inmates represents a significant community health issue. General disease prevention efforts must include prevention within correctional facilities.

Blood pressure was directly recorded by means of a capacitance transducer connected to a catheter in the brachial artery. Intrathoracic pressure with the Valsalva maneuver was recorded as mouth pressure by having the subject maintain an open glottis while expiring against a column of Hg during the lifts. Exercises included single-arm curls, overhead presses, and both double- and single-leg presses performed to failure at 80, 90, 95, and 100\% of maximum. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures rose rapidly to extremely high values during the concentric contraction phase for each lift and declined with the eccentric contraction. The greatest peak pressures occurred during the double-leg press where the mean value for the group was 320/250 mmHg, with pressures in one subject exceeding 480/350 mmHg. Peak pressures with the single-arm curl exercise reached a mean group value of 255/190 mmHg when repetitions were continued to failure. Mouth pressures of 30-50 Torr during a single maximum lift, or as subjects approached failure with a submaximal weight, indicate that a portion of the observed increase in blood pressure was caused by a Valsalva maneuver. It was concluded that when healthy young subjects perform weight-lifting exercises the mechanical compression of blood vessels combines with a potent pressor response and a Valsalva response to produce extreme elevations in blood pressure. Pressures are extreme even when exercise is performed with a relatively small muscle mass.},

Coffee intake represented more than 90\% of the total daily caffeine, and the 75th percentile was 4-Brazilian coffee-cup/day (s255. mL/day or ???123. mg caffeine/day). According to caffeine intake, patients were divided into two groups ({$<$} or ???123. mg caffeine/day). Patients with higher ingestion of caffeine had lower serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (?? upper limit of normal) (1.8. ??. 1.5 vs 2.3. ??. 1.5, p=. 0.04), lower frequencies of advanced (F3, F4) fibrosis (23.5\% vs 54.5\%, p{$<$}. 0.001) and of histological activity grade (A3, A4) observed in liver biopsies (13.8\% vs 36.9\%, p{$<$}. 0.001).

Therefore, this study aimed to describe the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy situation in Japan and assess the factors associated with such issues. This was a cross-sectional study based on an internet survey completed by 2956 people. Participants were asked to indicate how likely they were to get vaccinated for COVID-19. In addition, the participants responded to questions regarding sociodemographic factors, attitudes, and beliefs regarding COVID-19 infection and vaccination. The proportion of participants with a high likelihood of getting a COVID-19 vaccine was 62.1\%. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that vaccine acceptance was lower among several sociodemographic groups, such as women, adults aged 20--49 years, and those with a low-income level. Several psychological factors, especially the perceived effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine, and willingness to protect others by getting oneself vaccinated, were associated with vaccine acceptance. Our results indicate that the perceived effectiveness of the vaccine and willingness to protect others may play an important role in the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine.},

It advocates directly studying features of the local social and physical environment which might promote or inhibit health, illustrating this approach with some findings from a study in the West of Scotland, and suggests that improvements in public health might be achieved by focusing on places as well as on people. Social class is often brought into such analyses as a control factor. It is usually found that social class and area of residence each seem to predict morbidity and mortality independently, that is, when adjusting for the other. An important analysis from the Alameda County Study in California showed that residents in "poverty areas" experienced higher age, race and sex adjusted mortality over a follow up period compared with residents of non-poverty areas. This increased risk of death persisted when there was multivariate adjustment for baseline health status, race, income, employment status, education, access to medical care, health insurance coverage, and a whole range of behavioral factors often assumed to be the link between socio-economic status and poor health. It is concluded that these results support the hypothesis that properties of the socio-physical environment may be important contributors to the association between low socio-economic status and excess mortality, and that this contribution is independent of individual behaviors.},

An upward or downward mobility theory of drug involvement is discussed. (21 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Measles is an important infectious disease system both for its burden on public health and as an opportunity for studying nonlinear spatio-temporal disease dynamics. Traditional mechanistic models often struggle to fully capture the complex nonlinear spatio-temporal dynamics inherent in measles outbreaks. In this paper, we first develop a high-dimensional feed-forward neural network model with spatial features (SFNN) to forecast endemic measles outbreaks and systematically compare its predictive power with that of a classical mechanistic model (TSIR). We illustrate the utility of our model using England and Wales measles data from 1944-1965. These data present multiple modeling challenges due to the interplay between metapopulations, seasonal trends, and nonlinear dynamics related to demographic changes. Our results show that while the TSIR model yields similarly performant short-term (1 to 2 biweeks ahead) forecasts for highly populous cities, our neural network model (SFNN) consistently achieves lower root mean squared error (RMSE) across other forecasting windows. Furthermore, we show that our spatial-feature neural network model, without imposing mechanistic assumptions a priori, can uncover gravity-model-like spatial hierarchy of measles spread in which major cities play an important role in driving regional outbreaks. We then turn our attention to integrative approaches that combine mechanistic and machine learning models. Specifically, we investigate how the TSIR can be utilized to improve a state-of-the-art approach known as Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks (PINN) which explicitly combines compartmental models and neural networks. Our results show that the TSIR can facilitate the reconstruction of latent susceptible dynamics, thereby enhancing both forecasts in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and parameter inference of measles dynamics within the PINN. In summary, our results show that appropriately designed neural network-based models can outperform traditional mechanistic models for short to long-term forecasts, while simultaneously providing mechanistic interpretability. Our work also provides valuable insights into more effectively integrating machine learning models with mechanistic models to enhance public health responses to measles and similar infectious disease systems.},

  abstract = {Hepatitis B is one of the most common infectious diseases in the world. It has been estimated that 350 million people worldwide are chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers. The global prevalence of chronic HBV infection varies widely, from high ( {$>$} 8\%, e.g., Africa, Asia and the Western Pacific) to intermediate (2-7\% e.g., Southern and Eastern Europe) and low ({$<$} 2\%, e.g., Western Europe, North America and Australia). The predominant routes of transmission vary according to the endemicity of the HBV infection. In areas of high endemicity, perinatal transmission is the main route of transmission, whereas in areas of low endemicity, sexual contact amongst high-risk adults is predominant. Between one-third and one-quarter of people infected chronically with HBV are expected to develop progressive liver disease (including cirrhosis and primary liver cancer). Although mass vaccination programs have begun to control the spread of HBV infection, therapeutic intervention is the only option for those with established chronic HBV-associated liver disease. Until recently, the only treatment for chronic hepatitis B was the immune modulator, interferon (IFN) alpha. However, IFN alpha treatment has several disadvantages; it is expensive, it must be administered by injection, there are side-effects, and IFN alpha is poorly tolerated. Lamivudine, a nucleoside analogue, is the first effective, and well tolerated, oral treatment for chronic hepatitis B. In conclusion, although we are still some way from eradicating or curing chronic hepatitis B, the advent of lamivudine allows new populations to benefit from therapy and helps to address the global public health problem of hepatitis B.},

During the pandemic, this invisibility intersects with rising anti-Asian violence and other persistent structural inequities that contribute to higher COVID-19 mortality in older Asian Americans compared to non-Hispanic whites. This perspective describes how structural inequities in social determinants of health---namely immigration, language and telehealth access, and economic conditions---lead to increased COVID-19 mortality and barriers to care among older Asian Americans. Specifically, we discuss how the historically racialized immigration system has patterned older Asian immigrant subpopulations into working in frontline essential occupations with high COVID-19 exposure. The threat of ``public charge'' rule has also prevented Asian immigrants from receiving eligible public assistance including COVID-19 testing and vaccination programs. We highlight the language diversity among older Asian Americans and how language access remains unaddressed in clinical and non-clinical services and creates barriers to routine and COVID-19 related care, particularly in geographic regions with small Asian American populations. We discuss the economic insecurity of older Asian immigrants and how co-residence in multigenerational homes has exposed them to greater risk of coronavirus transmission. Using an intersectionality-informed approach to address structural inequities, we recommend the disaggregation of racial/ethnic data, meaningful inclusion of older Asian Americans in research and policy, and equitable investment in community and multi-sectoral partnerships to improve health and wellbeing of older Asian Americans.},

Single exponentials can be fitted reasonably well to the decay phase of clamped synaptic currents, although they contain many underlying components. The effective time constant depends on the fit interval. The smoothing effects on synaptic clamp currents of dendritic cables and series resistance are explored with a single cylinder + soma model, for inputs with different time courses. "Soma" and "cable" charging currents cannot be separated easily when the soma is much smaller than the dendrites. Subtractive soma capacitance compensation and series resistance compensation are discussed. In a hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurone model, voltage control at most dendritic sites is extremely poor. Parameter dependencies are illustrated. The effects of series resistance compound those of dendritic cables and depend on the "effective capacitance" of the cell. Plausible combinations of parameters can cause order-of-magnitude distortions to clamp current waveform measures of simulated Schaeffer collateral inputs. These voltage clamp problems are unlikely to be solved by the use of switch clamp methods.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, as the prevalence of chronic pain and health care costs have exploded, an opioid epidemic with adverse consequences has escalated. Efforts to increase opioid use and a campaign touting the alleged undertreatment of pain continue to be significant factors in the escalation. Many arguments in favor of opioids are based solely on traditions, expert opinion, practical experience and uncontrolled anecdotal observations. Over the past 20 years, the liberalization of laws governing the prescribing of opioids for the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain by the state medical boards has led to dramatic increases in opioid use. This has evolved into the present stage, with the introduction of new pain management standards by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) in 2000, an increased awareness of the right to pain relief, the support of various organizations supporting the use of opioids in large doses, and finally, aggressive marketing by the pharmaceutical industry. These positions are based on unsound science and blatant misinformation, and accompanied by the dangerous assumptions that opioids are highly effective and safe, and devoid of adverse events when prescribed by physicians. Results of the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) showed that an estimated 22.6 million, or 8.9\% of Americans, aged 12 or older, were current or past month illicit drug users, The survey showed that just behind the 7 million people who had used marijuana, 5.1 million had used pain relievers. It has also been shown that only one in 6 or 17.3\% of users of non-therapeutic opioids indicated that they received the drugs through a prescription from one doctor. The escalating use of therapeutic opioids shows hydrocodone topping all prescriptions with 136.7 million prescriptions in 2011, with all narcotic analgesics exceeding 238 million prescriptions. It has also been illustrated that opioid analgesics are now responsible for more deaths than the number of deaths from both suicide and motor vehicle crashes, or deaths from cocaine and heroin combined. A significant relationship exists between sales of opioid pain relievers and deaths. The majority of deaths (60\%) occur in patients when they are given prescriptions based on prescribing guidelines by medical boards, with 20\% of deaths in low dose opioid therapy of 100 mg of morphine equivalent dose or less per day and 40\% in those receiving morphine of over 100 mg per day. In comparison, 40\% of deaths occur in individuals abusing the drugs obtained through multiple prescriptions, doctor shopping, and drug diversion. The purpose of this comprehensive review is to describe various aspects of crisis of opioid use in the United States. The obstacles that must be surmounted are primarily inappropriate prescribing patterns, which are largely based on a lack of knowledge, perceived safety, and inaccurate belief of undertreatment of pain.},

To create this organized template, peptides were selected by using a pIII phage display library for their ability to nucleate ZnS or CdS nanocrystals. The successful peptides were expressed as pVIII fusion proteins into the crystalline capsid of the virus. The engineered viruses were exposed to semiconductor precursor solutions, and the resultant nanocrystals that were templated along the viruses to form nanowires were extensively characterized by using high-resolution analytical electron microscopy and photoluminescence. ZnS nanocrystals were well crystallized on the viral capsid in a hexagonal wurtzite or a cubic zinc blende structure, depending on the peptide expressed on the viral capsid. Electron diffraction patterns showed single-crystal type behavior from a polynanocrystalline area of the nanowire formed, suggesting that the nanocrystals on the virus were preferentially oriented with their [001] perpendicular to the viral surface. Peptides that specifically directed CdS nanocrystal growth were also engineered into the viral capsid to create wurtzite CdS virus-based nanowires. Lastly, heterostructured nucleation was achieved with a dual-peptide virus engineered to express two distinct peptides within the same viral capsid.

Peptides (selected through an evolutionary screening process) that exhibit control of composition, size, and phase during nanoparticle nucleation have been expressed on the highly ordered filamentous capsid of the M13 bacteriophage. The incorporation of specific, nucleating peptides into the generic scaffold of the M13 coat structure provides a viable template for the directed synthesis of semiconducting and magnetic materials. Removal of the viral template by means of annealing promoted oriented aggregation-based crystal growth, forming individual crystalline nanowires. The unique ability to interchange substrate-specific peptides into the linear self-assembled filamentous construct of the M13 virus introduces a material tunability that has not been seen in previous synthetic routes. Therefore, this system provides a genetic toolkit for growing and organizing nanowires from semiconducting and magnetic materials.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in children is mainly acquired via maternal transmission. Our aim was to identify mother-to-child-transmission (MTC) risk factors, namely those associated with maternal virological characteristics and mode of delivery. METHODS Women were included between October 1998 and September 2002 in six hospitals in Southern France on the basis of positive HCV serological status. Recorded data included maternal characteristics, circumstances of delivery and laboratory data concerning mother and child. Paediatric follow-up lasted 1 year, and 2 years for children with circulating HCV RNA. RESULTS A total of 214 mother-and-child pairs were analysed; 55 (26\%) were HCV/HIV co-infected. The probability of HCV transmission was three-fold higher for HCV/HIV-co-infected women (P = 0.05). Twelve children were HCV RNA positive at 1 year of age (MTC = 5.6\%); three became HCV RNA negative between 12 (M12) and 18 months of age (M18) and recovered normal alanine aminotransferase levels. Circulating HCV RNA was found in 137 (69\%) mothers. Mothers of infected children all displayed HCV viraemia (MTC = 8.8\%): six children were born of HCV/HIV-co-infected HCV RNA positive women (MTC = 13.6\%) and six from HCV monoinfected women with positive HCV RNA (MTC = 6.5\%). When maternal HCV RNA levels were below 6 log-IU/ml, the rate of transmission was significantly higher in the case of HCV/HIV co-infection (odds ratio = 8.3, 95\% confidence interval, 1.4-47.5) P = 0.01. This association did not, however, exist for HCV RNA-positive mothers with levels of at least 6 log-IU/ml. Rate of transmission did not differ significantly between children born by vaginal delivery or caesarean section after membrane rupture and those born by elective caesarean section independently of HIV status.},

Vietnamese males have the highest incidence of liver cancer of any ethnic group, and HBV infection is a serious and prevalent health problem among Vietnamese immigrants. Guided by the Health Belief Model framework, the purpose of the present study was to assess levels of perceived risk, severity, barriers and benefits, and cues to action in HBV screening and vaccination in relation to actual screening and vaccination behavior in a sample of Vietnamese adults. The study consisted of 359 Vietnamese adults residing in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The majority of participants were immigrants (98.1\%) and had low socio-economic and educational status. Only 8.8\% of participants reported being screened and 7.3\% vaccinated for HBV. Participants who had been screened reported feeling at higher risk and perceived HBV infection to be more likely to lead to liver cancer and death than those who had not been screened. In addition, participants who had been screened reported fewer perceived barriers and more cues to action than unscreened participants. Compared to participants who had been vaccinated, unvaccinated participants were more likely to report feeling healthy and a lack of knowledge about where to obtain HBV testing as barriers. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that perceived barriers were negatively associated with screening behavior as well as vaccination behavior. These results suggest that community-based, culturally appropriate interventions for Vietnamese Americans should directly address barriers to screening and vaccination in order to enhance screening and vaccination rates in this underserved population.},

  abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused millions of deaths and substantial morbidity worldwide. Intense scientific effort to understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in daunting numbers of genomic sequences. We witnessed evolutionary events that could mostly be inferred indirectly before, such as the emergence of variants with distinct phenotypes, for example transmissibility, severity and immune evasion. This Review explores the mechanisms that generate genetic variation in SARS-CoV-2, underlying the within-host and population-level processes that underpin these events. We examine the selective forces that likely drove the evolution of higher transmissibility and, in some cases, higher severity during the first year of the pandemic and the role of antigenic evolution during the second and third years, together with the implications of immune escape and reinfections, and the increasing evidence for and potential relevance of recombination. In order to understand how major lineages, such as variants of concern (VOCs), are generated, we contrast the evidence for the chronic infection model underlying the emergence of VOCs with the possibility of an animal reservoir playing a role in SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and conclude that the former is more likely. We evaluate uncertainties and outline scenarios for the possible future evolutionary trajectories of SARS-CoV-2.},

Health status, therefore, should be of concern to policy makers in every sector, not solely those involved in health policy. As a response to this global challenge, WHO is launching a Commission on Social Determinants of Health, which will review the evidence, raise societal debate, and recommend policies with the goal of improving health of the world's most vulnerable people.

The role of the underlying liver disease on patient prognosis remains unclear. AIM To assess the impact of the underlying liver disease on the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and death. METHODS Data related to the occurrence of HCC and death were collected during a 21-year period among patients with cirrhosis related to alcoholic liver disease (ALD) (n = 529), chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (n = 145) or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (n = 78). RESULTS At inclusion, ALD patients were younger than HCV and NAFLD patients (56 vs. 67 vs. 63 years; p{$<$}0.001) and had worse liver function (percent of patients with Child-Pugh stages B or C: 48\% vs. 8\% vs. 17\%; p{$<$}0.001). During follow-up, 85 patients developed HCC and 379 died. The 10-year cumulative incidence rate of HCC was lower in ALD patients than in HCV and NAFLD patients (8.4\% vs. 22.0\% vs. 23.7\%; p{$<$}0.001). The 10-year cumulative incidence rates of mortality were not statistically different between ALD, HCV and NAFLD patients (58.1\% vs. 47.7\% vs. 49.9\%; p = 0.078). Alcohol abstinence and viral eradication were associated with reduced mortality among ALD and HCV patients, respectively. In multivariate analyses, ALD was associated with a reduced risk of HCC (0.39; 95\% CI, 0.20-0.76; p = 0.005) but with a higher risk of mortality (1.53; 95\% CI, 1.20-1.95; p{$<$}0.001). ALD patients died more frequently from decompensation of cirrhosis. CONCLUSION Despite a lower incidence of HCC, patients with ALD-related cirrhosis have a worse outcome than those with chronic HCV infection or NAFLD-related cirrhosis.}

During the last third of the twentieth century, the United States moved toward a new regime of residential segregation characterized by moderating racial-ethnic segregation and rising class segregation, yielding a world in which the spatial organization of cities and the location of groups and people within them will increasingly be determined by an interaction of race and class and in which segregation will stem less from overt prejudice and discrimination than from political decisions about land use, such as density zoning.},

  abstract = {Background: Infectious diseases continue to cause significant impact on human health. Vaccines are instrumental in preventing infectious diseases and mitigating pandemics and epidemics. SARS-CoV-2 is the most recent example of an urgent pandemic that requires the development of vaccines. This study combined real-world data and geospatial visualization techniques to demonstrate methods to monitor and communicate the uptake and impact of existing and new vaccines. Methods: Observational data of existing pediatric rotavirus vaccines were used as an example. A large US national insurance claims database was accessed to build an analytic dataset for a 20-year period (1996--2017). For each week and multiple geographic scales, animated spatial and non-spatial visualization techniques were applied to demonstrate changes in seasonal rotavirus epidemic curves and population-based disease rates before, during, and after vaccine introduction in 2006. The geographic scales included national, state, county and zip code tabulation areas. An online web-based digital atlas was built to display either continuous or snapshot visualizations of disease patterns, vaccine uptake, and improved health outcomes after vaccination (http://www.mapvaccines.com). Results: Over 17 million zip code-weeks of data were available for analysis. The animations show geospatial patterns of rotavirus-related medical encounter rates peaking every year from November -- February prior to vaccine availability in 2006. Visualizations showed increasing vaccination coverage rates at all geographic scales over time. Declines in medical encounter rates accelerated as vaccination coverage rapidly increased after 2010. The data maps also identified geographic hotspots with low vaccination rates and persistent disease rates. Conclusion: This project developed novel web-based methods to communicate location and time-based vaccine uptake and the related reduction in medical visits due to viral infection. Future applications of the visualization could be used by health agencies to monitor known or novel disease patterns over time in conjunction with close assessment of current and future vaccine utilization.},

  abstract = {The maturation of genomic surveillance in the past decade has enabled tracking of the emergence and spread of epidemics at an unprecedented level. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, genomic data revealed that local epidemics varied considerably in the frequency of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineage importation and persistence, likely due to a combination of COVID-19 restrictions and changing connectivity. Here, we show that local COVID-19 epidemics are driven by regional transmission, including across international boundaries, but can become increasingly connected to distant locations following the relaxation of public health interventions. By integrating genomic, mobility, and epidemiological data, we find abundant transmission occurring between both adjacent and distant locations, supported by dynamic mobility patterns. We find that changing connectivity significantly influences local COVID-19 incidence. Our findings demonstrate a complex meaning of ``local'' when investigating connected epidemics and emphasize the importance of collaborative interventions for pandemic prevention and mitigation.},

These issues are also independent of more specific arguments of mandatory vaccination of healthcare workers as a condition of employment. As important as these issues are, they do not consider the complex politics of ongoing settler colonialism and First Nations community relations. In this paper, we also set aside the very real problems of disinformation, hesitancy, scientific and health illiteracy, and other concerns that drive vaccine hesitancy and refusal. These affect all communities, including First Nations communities. We, instead describe the dominant arguments in favour of mandatory vaccination and critique them in terms of the disputed legitimacy of Settler-Colonial decision-making as it impacts First Nations communities. We contend cultural responsiveness and safety---not state compulsion---must remain the first principles of any engagement---including vaccination---with First Nations Peoples, families, and communities.},

  abstract = {The mouse mdr2 gene (and its human homologue MDR3, also called MDR2) encodes a P-glycoprotein that is present in high concentration in the bile canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. The 129/OlaHsd mice with a homozygous disruption of the mdr2 gene (-/- mice) lack this P-glycoprotein in the canalicular membrane. These mice are unable to secrete phospholipids into bile, showing an essential role for the mdr2 P-glycoprotein in the transport of phosphatidylcholine across the canalicular membrane. The complete absence of phospholipids from bile leads to a hepatic disease, which becomes manifest shortly after birth and shows progression to an end stage in the course of 3 months. The liver pathology is that of a nonsuppurative inflammatory cholangitis with portal inflammation and ductular proliferation, consistent with toxic injury of the biliary system from bile salts unaccompanied by phospholipids. Thus, the mdr2 (-/-) mice can serve as an animal model for studying mechanisms and potential interventions in nonsuppurative inflammatory cholangitis (in a generic sense) in human disease, be it congenital or acquired. When the mice are 4 to 6 months of age, preneoplastic lesions develop in the liver, progressing to metastatic liver cancer in the terminal phase. The mdr2 (-/-) mice therefore also provide a tumor progression model of value for the study of hepatic carcinogenesis. Interestingly, also in this regard, the model mimicks human disease, because chronic inflammation of the biliary system in humans may similarly carry increased cancer risk.},

However, few studies have examined the association between current depression and smoking and even fewer used large cross-sectional data to support these findings. Using the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data (n = 248,800), we compared rates of lifetime depression, lifetime anxiety, current depression, and current depressive symptoms among smokers who unsuccessfully attempted to quit (unsuccessful quitters), former smokers (successful quitters), and smokers who made no attempts to quit (non-quitters). Unsuccessful quitters experienced more lifetime depression and anxiety than non-quitters (OR = 1.2; 95\% CI, 1.0-1.4), whereas successful quitters experienced less (OR = 0.7, 95\% CI, 0.6-0.8). Current depression prevalence was 14.3\% among non-quitters, 18.8\% among unsuccessful quitters, and 8.0\% among successful quitters. On average, unsuccessful quitters also experienced more days of depressive symptoms during the previous month than either non-quitters or successful quitters. Our results suggest that smokers who attempt to quit unsuccessfully may experience lifetime depression as well as current depression at a higher rate than other smokers and former smokers.},

Their highest concentrations are in Los Angeles, Orange, and Santa Clara Counties, the Inland Empire, and the San Joaquin Valley. Those with incomes too high for Medi-Cal are concentrated in the greater San Francisco Bay Area, where premium costs are highest. Even with access to Covered California, lack of subsidies will keep many of them from coverage.

COPD is the fourth leading cause of death and, in contrast to other major chronic diseases in the United States, has not shown declines in mortality over the past 20 years. Mortality trends reflect patterns of initiation of cigarette smoking that occurred 30 to 50 years previously. Current mortality trends indicate that COPD mortality may be leveling off among white males, but will continue to increase among women, African-Americans, and the elderly. Recent studies indicate that early identification of individuals with airflow obstruction and smoking intervention can halt the progression of COPD, but widespread screening and intervention programs have not yet been established},

The subscale combined with the FACT, (FACT-BMT) is a 47-item, valid and reliable measure of five dimensions of quality of life in bone marrow transplant patients. The three-step validation process involved the generation and selection of BMT-specific items and the testing of the overall measure. Items were selected from a list produced by seven oncology experts and 15 patients and were designed to assess content not represented in the general FACT items. A total of 182 patients completed the FACT-BMT at baseline, prior to BMT. An analysis measuring sensitivity to change was performed with 74 patients after transplantation and 60 patients over the three time-points of baseline, hospital discharge and 100 days. The FACT-BMT and all subscales were correlated, sensitivity to change was measured, and the internal consistency for each scale was calculated. Coefficients of reliability and validity ranged from 0.86 to 0.89 for the entire FACT-BMT and 0.54 to 0.63 for the BMTS. The BMTS was able to discriminate patients on the basis of performance status rating and also demonstrated sensitivity to change over time. The FACT-BMT has good psychometric properties for use in assessing quality of life in bone marrow transplant patients. The addition of the bone marrow transplant subscale to the general FACT measure makes it an excellent choice for use in BMT clinical trials.},

The in vitro uptake rate and kinetic parameters were studied by uptake of 14C-labelled fructose. From Eadie-Hofstee plots, based on the results of the in vitro uptake experiment, K(m) and Vmax for the different steady-state conditions were determined. These results demonstrate that as fructose concentrations increase, fructose consumption rates and K(m) increase and Vmax slightly decreases. However, remarkably a large discrepancy was observed between in vivo determined consumption rates in the continuous culture and the in vitro uptake rates from the 14C-labelled fructose uptake experiment on cells from an identical steady-state condition. In every condition the in vivo consumption rate was approx. 2-3 times higher than the in vitro uptake rate. A comparable discrepancy was observed for glucose uptake rates; however, in vivo and in vitro galactose uptake rates were identical. These observations imply that kinetic analyses of sugar transport mechanisms can only be performed correctly when accompanied by a comparison with in vivo determined consumption rates.},

We undertook a public health practice-research partnership to develop a strategy for detecting spatial clusters of early stage breast cancer using registry data. METHODS: Spatial patterns of early stage breast cancer throughout Michigan were analyzed comparing several scales of spatial support, and different clustering algorithms. RESULTS: Analyses relying on point data identified spatial clusters not detected using data aggregated into census block groups, census tracts, or legislative districts. Further, using point data, Cuzick-Edwards' nearest neighbor test identified clusters not detected by the SaTScan spatial scan statistic. Regression and simulation analyses lent credibility to these findings. CONCLUSIONS: In these cluster analyses of early stage breast cancer in Michigan, spatial analyses of point data are more sensitive than analyses relying on data aggregated into polygons, and the Cuzick-Edwards' test is more sensitive than the SaTScan spatial scan statistic, with acceptable Type I error. Cuzick-Edwards' test also enables presentation of results in a manner easily communicated to public health practitioners. The approach outlined here should help cancer registries conduct and communicate results of geographic analyses.},

This systematic review aimed to synthesise the literature on mechanisms of delivery for a range of infectious disease-\-related interventions provided to conflict-\-affected women, children and adolescents. Methods\enspace{} We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL and PsychINFO databases for literature published in English from January 1990 to March 2018. Eligible publications reported on conflict-\-affected neonates, children, adolescents or women in LMICs who received an infectious disease intervention. We extracted and synthesised information on delivery characteristics, including delivery site and personnel involved, as well as barriers and facilitators, and we tabulated reported intervention coverage and effectiveness data. Results\enspace{} A majority of the 194 eligible publications reported on intervention delivery in sub-\-Saharan Africa. Vaccines for measles and polio were the most commonly reported interventions, followed by malaria treatment. Over two-\-thirds of reported interventions were delivered in camp settings for displaced families. The use of clinics as a delivery site was reported across all intervention types, but outreach and community-\-based delivery were also reported for many interventions. Key barriers to service delivery included restricted access to target populations; conversely, adopting social mobilisation strategies and collaborating with community figures were reported as facilitating intervention delivery. Few publications reported on intervention coverage, mostly reporting variable coverage for vaccines, and fewer reported on intervention effectiveness, mostly for malaria treatment regimens. Conclusions\enspace{} Despite an increased focus on health outcomes in humanitarian crises, our review highlights important gaps in the literature on intervention delivery among specific subpopulations and geographies. This indicates a need for more rigorous research and reporting on effective strategies for delivering infectious disease interventions in different conflict contexts.

  abstract = {NAFLD affects a large proportion of the US population and its incidence and prevalence are increasing to epidemic proportions around the world. As with other liver diseases that cause cirrhosis, NAFLD increases the risk of liver cancer, a disease with poor outcomes and limited therapeutic options. The incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are also rising, and HCC is now the leading cause of obesity-related cancer deaths in middle-aged men in the USA. In this Review, we summarize the correlations between liver cancer and NAFLD-related cirrhosis, and the role of the metabolic syndrome in the development of liver cancer from diverse aetiologies, including HCV-mediated cirrhosis. Recent advances in understanding the progression of NAFLD to HCC from preclinical models will also be discussed. Targeted genetic manipulation of certain metabolic or stress-response pathways, including one-carbon metabolism, NF-{$\kappa$}B, PTEN and microRNAs, has been valuable in elucidating the pathways that regulate carcinogenesis in NAFLD. Although tremendous advances have occurred in the identification of diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities to reduce the progression of NAFLD, considerable gaps in our knowledge remain with regard to the mechanisms by which NAFLD and its risk factors promote liver cancer.}

METHODS: Our prediction model was derived from data obtained on 17,654 Japanese aged 40 to 69 years who participated in health checkups (follow-up: 1993-2006). Cox proportional hazards regression was applied to obtain coefficients for each predictor. RESULTS: During follow-up, a total of 104 cases of HCC were newly diagnosed. After checking the model fit, we incorporated age, sex, alcohol consumption, body mass index, diabetes, coffee consumption, and hepatitis B and C virus infection into the prediction model. The model showed satisfactory discrimination (Harrell's c-index=0.94) and was well calibrated (the overall observed/expected ratio=1.03, 95\% confidence interval=0.83-1.29). We also developed a simple risk scoring system. Those subjects with total scores of 17 or more under this system (score range: -1 to 19) had an estimated 10-year HCC risk of over 90\%; those with 4 points or less had an estimated risk of less than 0.1\%. CONCLUSION: We developed a simple 10-year risk prediction model for HCC in the Japanese general population as a public education tool.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite application of cryogen spray (CS) precooling, customary treatment of port wine stain (PWS) birthmarks with a single laser pulse does not result in complete lesion blanching for a majority of patients. One obvious reason is nonselective absorption by epidermal melanin, which limits the maximal safe radiant exposure. Another possible reason for treatment failure is screening of laser light within large PWS vessels, which prevents uniform heating of the entire vessel lumen. Our aim is to identify the parameters of sequential CS cooling and laser irradiation that will allow optimal photocoagulation of various PWS blood vessels with minimal risk of epidermal thermal damage. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Light and heat transport in laser treatment of PWS are simulated using a custom 3D Monte Carlo model and 2D finite element method, respectively. Protein denaturation in blood and skin are calculated using the Arrhenius kinetic model with tissue-specific coefficients. Simulated PWS vessels with diameters of 30-150\,\textmu m are located at depths of 200-600\,\textmu m, and shading by nearby vessels is accounted for according to PWS histology data from the literature. For moderately pigmented and dark skin phototypes, PWS blood vessel coagulation and epidermal thermal damage are assessed for various parameters of sequential CS cooling and 532-nm laser irradiation, i.e. the number of pulses in a sequence (1-5), repetition rate (7-30\,Hz), and radiant exposure. RESULTS: Simulations of PWS treatment in darker skin phototypes indicate specific cooling/irradiation sequences that provide significantly higher efficacy and safety as compared to the customary single-pulse approach across a wide range of PWS blood vessel diameters and depths. The optimal sequences involve three to five laser pulses at repetition rates of 10-15\,Hz. CONCLUSIONS: Application of the identified cooling/irradiation sequences may offer improved therapeutic outcome for patients with resistant PWS, especially in darker skin phototypes.},

Using phylodynamic analysis, we estimate that the basic reproduction number of the virus was initially around 2.5, dropping by more than two-thirds following the implementation of social distancing measures. We further report high levels of transmission heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 spread, with between 2-10\% of infected individuals resulting in 80\% of secondary infections.

A mixed-effects, multivariable, random-intercept negative binomial model was used to explore the association between ZIP Code--Tabulation Area level SVI and COVID-19 vaccination coverage stratified by the availability of a designated vaccine access site. Lower COVID-19 vaccine coverage was observed in ZIP codes with the highest overall SVIs (adjusted mean difference (aMD) = -13, 95\% CI, -23.8 to -2.1, p {$<$} 0.01), socioeconomic characteristics theme (aMD = -16.6, 95\% CI, -27.3 to -5.7, p = 0.01) and housing and transportation theme (aMD = -18.3, 95\% CI, -29.6 to -7.1, p {$<$} 0.01) compared with the ZIP codes with the lowest SVI scores. The vaccine coverage was lower in ZIP Code--Tabulation Areas with higher median percentages of Hispanics (aMD = -3.3, 95\% CI, -6.5 to -0.1, p = 0.04) and Blacks (aMD = -3.7, 95\% CI, -6.4 to -1, p = 0.01). SVI negatively impacted COVID-19 vaccine coverage in Texas. Access to vaccine sites did not address disparities related to vaccine coverage among minority populations. These findings are relevant to guide the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in regions with similar demographic and geospatial characteristics.},

  abstract = {Background:\enspace{} There are only limited studies on access to COVID-19 vaccines and identifying the most appropriate health centres for performing vaccination in metropolitan areas. This study aimed to measure potential spatial access to COVID-19 vaccination centres in Mashhad, the second-most populous city in Iran. Methods:\enspace{} The 2021 age structure of the urban census tracts was integrated into the enhanced two-step floating catchment area model to improve accuracy. The model was developed based on three different access scenarios: only public hospitals, only public healthcare centres and both (either hospitals or healthcare centres) as potential vaccination facilities. The weighted decision-matrix and analytic hierarchy process, based on four criteria (i.e. service area, accessibility index, capacity of vaccination centres and distance to main roads), were used to choose potential vaccination centres looking for the highest suitability for residents. Global Moran's index (GMI) was used to measure the spatial autocorrelation of the accessibility index in different scenarios and the proposed model. Results:\enspace{} There were 26 public hospitals and 271 public healthcare centres in the study area. Although the exclusive use of public healthcare centres for vaccination can provide the highest accessibility in the eastern and north-eastern parts of the study area, our findings indicate that including both public hospitals and public healthcare centres provide high accessibility to vaccination in central urban part. Therefore, a combination of public hospitals and public healthcare centres is recommended for efficient vaccination coverage. The value of GMI for the proposed model (accessibility to selected vaccination centres) was calculated as 0.53 (Z\,=\,162.42, P\,{$<$}\,0.01). Both GMI and Z-score values decreased in the proposed model, suggesting an enhancement in accessibility to COVID-19 vaccination services. Conclusions:\enspace{} The periphery and poor areas of the city had the least access to COVID-19 vaccination centres. Measuring spatial access to COVID-19 vaccination centres can provide valuable insights for urban public health decisionmakers. Our model, coupled with geographical information systems, provides more efficient vaccination coverage by identifying the most suitable healthcare centres, which is of special importance when only few centres are available.},

They also study small sample properties of these estimators by model-based and design-based simulation studies. Results show large reductions in mean squared error relative to direct area-specific estimators and other estimators obtained by "simulated" censuses. The authors also apply the proposed method to estimate poverty incidences and poverty gaps in Spanish provinces by gender with mean squared errors estimated by the mentioned parametric bootstrap method. For the Spanish data, results show a significant reduction in coefficient of variation of the proposed empirical best estimators over direct estimators for practically all domains.

We calculated spatial coverage by establishing circular buffer zones using Euclidean distances, and irregular zones around the vaccination sites using Dijkstra's algorithm on the city's street network.~Results: The spatial coverage of the program was 78.4\% using the circular buffer zones, and 60.2\% using Dijsktra's algorithm. The spatial accessibility analysis revealed that the periphery of the city had the lowest accessibility to the program. This peripheral area is a very critical zone because it is an urban-rural interface, which represents a risk for the re-introduction of rabies in the city.~Conclusions: The 2SFCA spatial accessibility model is an effective tool to identify isolated areas, evaluate health services use more precisely, and provide basis for their strategic location. We concluded that this approach had the potential to improve resource efficiency when planning rabies control programs in urban environments such as Bogot\'a. The findings emphasize the need for surveillance and intervention in isolated areas with low access to services.},

In Italy, coffee consumption is high, thus allowing the investigation of the topic over a broad range of consumption. A hospital-based case-control study was conducted in Italy in 1999-2002, including 185 incidents, histologically confirmed cases of hepatocellular carcinoma aged 43-84 years. Controls were 412 subjects admitted to the same hospitals' networks for acute, non-neoplastic diseases unrelated to diet. Coffee and tea consumption were assessed using a validated food-frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding the 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were computed using unconditional multiple logistic regression, adjusting for hepatitis viruses seropositivity, alcohol intake, smoking habits and other potential confounding factors. Compared to people who drunk {$<$}14 cups/week of coffee, the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma decreased for increasing levels of consumption (OR=0.4, 95\% CI: 0.2-1.1 for {$>$}or=28 cups/week, p for trend = 0.02). In the present study, inverse relations were observed across strata of hepatitis C and, B virus infections and alcohol drinking. No significant association emerged with consumption of decaffeinated coffee (OR=0.7, 95\% CI=0.2-2.5) or tea (OR=1.4, 95\% CI=0.8-2.7). The present study supports the hypothesis of a favourable effect of coffee, though not decaffeinated coffee and tea, on the risk on hepatocellular carcinoma.},

  abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary liver malignancy and is an international public health concern, constituting one of the most deadly cancers worldwide. Infection with hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus is a major risk factor for HCC in developed countries. Emerging evidence indicates that there are other important lifestyle factors that contribute to the international burden of HCC, such as alcohol consumption, diabetes, obesity, and the intake of aflotoxin-contaminated food. Obesity and diabetes are also likely to be risk factors for HCC, the most frequent subtype of liver cancer. The chief pathway by which obesity increases risk involves the association between obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Coffee consumption has been studied extensively and appears to have a favorable effect on the prevention of liver diseases, including HCC. One hypothesis suggests that coffee intake lowers serum levels of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), which is associated with a lower incidence of HCC. It is estimated that more than 80\% of HCC cases are attributable to four principal causes that are avoidable. It is difficult to make dietary recommendations, because it is unknown whether consuming higher amounts of specific antioxidants will decrease the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. A diet rich that is in polyunsaturated fatty acids and, possibly, B-carotene could reduce the risk of HCC, and high dietary GL is associated with an increased risk independently of cirrhosis or diabetes.},

However, suitable systems to transplant hepatocytes and promote long-term engraftment must be developed. In this study, highly porous, biodegradable sponges were fabricated from poly (L-lactic acid) (PLA), and poly (DL-lacticco-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and utilized to transplant hepatocytes into the mesentery of three groups of Lewis rats. The portal vein was shunted to the inferior vena cava in one group of rats (PCS). The second group of animals received a PCS and a 70\% hepatectomy on the day of sponge-hepatocyte implantation (PCS + HEP), and the control group (CON) received no surgical stimulation. The sponges were vascularized by ingrowth of fibrovascular tissue over the first 7 days in vivo. Approximately 95-99\% of the implanted hepatocytes (determined utilizing computer-assisted image analysis) died in all three experimental groups during this time. The number of engrafted hepatocytes in the CON group further decreased over the next 7 days to 1.3 +/- 1.1\% of the original cell number. However, the number of engrafted hepatocytes in the PCS and PCS + HEP increased over this time to 6 +/- 1\% and 5 +/- 2\%, respectively. The number of engrafted hepatocytes in the PCS group continued to increase over the next 2.5 months to a value of 26 +/- 12\% of the initial cell number, and a large number of engrafted hepatocytes was still present at 6 months. These results indicate that stable new tissues can be engineered by transplanting hepatocytes on biodegradable sponges into heterotopic locations if appropriate stimulation is provided.},

This report describes factors associated with nonparticipation in a population-based, case-control study of breast cancer and discusses ways to overcome barriers to participation. METHODS: Contact and cooperation rates were calculated for participants in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS), stratified by case status, age, race, and race of interviewer. Demographic and breast cancer risk factor characteristics of partial and full responders also were compared. RESULTS: Contact rates and cooperation rates varied by case/control status and demographic characteristics. Contact rates were lower among controls, younger women, and black women. Cooperation rates were lower among controls, older women, and black cases. Cooperation rates were higher among both black and nonblack women when participants and interviewers were concordant on race. CONCLUSIONS: Obstacles to recruitment seem to differ among race and age subgroups, suggesting that recruitment strategies may need to be tailored to potential participants based upon demographic characteristics. Strategies have been implemented to improve response rates in this and other epidemiologic studies; however, additional research and innovation in this area are needed.},

The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States tripled between 1975 and 2005, and is expected to increase further, and to remain elevated for more than 20 years. Curing hepatitis C infection in patients with cirrhosis through treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin reduces the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Several noncurative treatments also appear to reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Prospective studies report a reduced incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma among patients treated with a mixture of carotenoids with or without myo-inositol, with vitamin K(2), or with polyprenoic acid (an acyclic retinoid). Uncontrolled and/or retrospective studies have reported beneficial effects of treatment with Sho-saiko-to, glycyrrhizin and ursodeoxycholic acid on hepatocellular carcinoma incidence. Meta-analyses of epidemiologic studies show a reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma among liver disease patients who drink two or more cups of coffee per day. Numerous agents prevent or reduce hepatocarcinogenesis in animal models. An ongoing Phase II clinical trial is evaluating S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) as a potential chemopreventive agent in hepatitis C cirrhosis. Overall, these data suggest that chemoprevention of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic hepatitis C is an achievable objective.},

  abstract = {The understanding of the control of metabolic flux in plants requires integrated mathematical formulations of gene and protein expression, enzyme kinetics, and developmental biology. Plants have a large number of metabolically active compartments, and non-steady-state conditions are frequently encountered. Consequently steady-state metabolic flux balance and isotopic flux balance modeling approaches have limited utility in probing plant metabolic systems. Transient isotopic flux analysis and kinetic modeling are powerful proven techniques for the quantification of metabolic fluxes in compartmentalized, dynamic metabolic systems. These tools are now widely used to address metabolic flux responses to environmental and genetic perturbations in plant metabolism. Continued developments in isotopic and kinetic modeling, quantifying metabolite exchange between compartments, and transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms governing enzyme level and activity will enable simulation of large sections of plant metabolism under non-steady-state conditions. Metabolic control analysis will continue to make substantial contributions to the understanding of quantitative distribution of control of flux. From the synergy between mathematical models and experiments, creative methods for controlling the distribution of flux by genetic or environmental means will be discovered and rationally implemented.},

  abstract = {Background: Although the relationship between diet and disease is well established, sustainable dietary changes that would affect risk for disease have been difficult to achieve. Whereas individual factors are traditional explanations for the inability of some people to change dietary habits, little research has investigated how the physical availability of healthy foods affects individuals' diets. This study examines the distribution of food stores and food service places by neighborhood wealth and racial segregation. Methods: Names and addresses of places to buy food in Mississippi, North Carolina, Maryland, and Minnesota were obtained from respective departments of health and agriculture. Addresses were geocoded to census tracts. Median house values were used to estimate neighborhood wealth, while the proportion of black residents was used to measure neighborhood racial segregation. Results: Compared to the poorest neighborhoods, large numbers of supermarkets and gas stations with convenience stores are located in wealthier neighborhoods. There are 3 times fewer places to consume alcoholic beverages in the wealthiest compared to the poorest neighborhoods (prevalence ratio [PR]=0.3, 95\% confidence interval [CI]=0.1-0.6). Regarding neighborhood segregation, there are 4 times more supermarkets located in white neighborhoods compared to black neighborhoods (PR=4.3, 95\% CI=1.5-12.5). Conclusions: Without access to supermarkets, which offer a wide variety of foods at lower prices, poor and minority communities may not have equal access to the variety of healthy food choices available to nonminority and wealthy communities.

An integrated framework draws theoretical perspectives from both approaches and from public health. Determinants of women's health in the geopolitical environment include country-specific history and geography, policies and services, legal rights, organizations and institutions, and structures that shape gender and economic inequality. Culture, norms and sanctions at the country and community level, and sociodemographic characteristics at the individual level, influence women's productive and reproductive roles in the household and workplace. Social capital, roles, psychosocial stresses and resources, health services, and behaviors mediate social, economic and cultural effects on health outcomes. Inequality between and within households contributes to the patterning of women's health. Within the framework, relationships may vary depending upon women's lifestage and cohort experience. Examples of other relevant theoretical frameworks are discussed. The conclusion suggests strategies to improve data, influence policy, and extend research to better understand the effect of gender and socioeconomic inequality on women's health. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {Genome sequencing dramatically increased our ability to understand cellular response to perturbation. Integrating system-wide measurements such as gene expression with networks of protein-protein interactions and transcription factor binding revealed critical insights into cellular behavior. However, the potential of systems biology approaches is limited by difficulties in integrating metabolic measurements across the functional levels of the cell despite their being most closely linked to cellular phenotype. To address this limitation, we developed a model-based approach to correlate mRNA and metabolic flux data that combines information from both interaction network models and flux determination models. We started by quantifying 5,764 mRNAs, 54 metabolites, and 83 experimental (13)C-based reaction fluxes in continuous cultures of yeast under stress in the absence or presence of global regulator Gcn4p. Although mRNA expression alone did not directly predict metabolic response, this correlation improved through incorporating a network-based model of amino acid biosynthesis (from r = 0.07 to 0.80 for mRNA-flux agreement). The model provides evidence of general biological principles: rewiring of metabolic flux (i.e., use of different reaction pathways) by transcriptional regulation and metabolite interaction density (i.e., level of pairwise metabolite-protein interactions) as a key biosynthetic control determinant. Furthermore, this model predicted flux rewiring in studies of follow-on transcriptional regulators that were experimentally validated with additional (13)C-based flux measurements. As a first step in linking metabolic control and genetic regulatory networks, this model underscores the importance of integrating diverse data types in large-scale cellular models. We anticipate that an integrated approach focusing on metabolic measurements will facilitate construction of more realistic models of cellular regulation for understanding diseases and constructing strains for industrial applications.},

Methods: Annual ratios (2008--2016) of providers to pediatric population were calculated by census tract in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Marginal logistic regression was used to estimate the independent association between neighborhood racial composition and access to pediatric primary care controlling for confounders. Results: In general, low access to care was associated with greater neighborhood disadvantage (e.g., SES, \% poverty, \% public insurance). After controlling for neighborhood indicators of disadvantage, risk of being in the lowest quintile of access significantly increased as the percent of non-Hispanic Black residents increased. Conclusion: A new measure of pediatric primary care accessibility demonstrates a persistent disparity in primary care access for predominantly non-Hispanic Black neighborhoods.},

Methods---Information reported on death certificates, which are completed by funeral directors, attending physicians, medical examiners, and coroners, is presented in descriptive tabulations. The original records are filed in state registration offices. Statistical information is compiled in a national database through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program of the National Center for Health Statistics. Causes of death are processed in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. Results---In 2015, a total of 2,712,630 deaths were reported in the United States. The age-adjusted death rate was 733.1 deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population, an increase of 1.2\% from the 2014 rate. Life expectancy at birth was 78.8 years, a decrease of 0.1 year from 2014. Life expectancy decreased from 2014 to 2015 for non-Hispanic white males (0.2 year), non-Hispanic white females (0.1), non-Hispanic black males (0.4), non-Hispanic black females (0.1), Hispanic males (0.1), and Hispanic females (0.2). Age-specific death rates increased in 2015 from 2014 for age groups 5--14, 15--24, 25--34, 35--44, 55--64, 65--74, and 85 and over. The 15 leading causes of death in 2015 remained the same as in 2014. The infant mortality rate, 5.90 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015, did not change significantly from the rate of 5.82 in 2014. Conclusions---The age-adjusted death rate increased for the first time since 2005. Life expectancy for the total population decreased for the first time since 1993.},

This study describes an approach to add an inductive component to an osteoconductive scaffold for bone tissue engineering. We report the release of bioactive vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from a mineralized, porous, degradable polymer scaffold. Three dimensional, porous scaffolds of the copolymer 85 : 15 poly(lactide-co-glycolide) were fabricated by including the growth factor into a gas foaming/particulate leaching process. The scaffold was then mineralized via incubation in a simulated body fluid. Growth of a bone-like mineral film on the inner pore surfaces of the porous scaffold is confirmed by mass increase measurements and quantification of phosphate content within scaffolds. Release of 125I-labeled VEGF was tracked over a 15 day period to determine release kinetics from the mineralized scaffolds. Sustained release from the mineralized scaffolds was achieved, and growth of the mineral film had only a minor effect on the release kinetics from the scaffolds. The VEGF released from the mineralized and non-mineralized scaffolds was over 70\% active for up to 12 days following mineralization treatment, and the growth of mineral had little effect on total scaffold porosity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND In the past decade there has been an increase in the use of treatment designed to conserve the breast for women with breast cancer. The extent to which such treatment has been adopted in various regions of the country and whether characteristics of hospitals and patients predict its use is not known, however. METHODS We used national data on Medicare claims for inpatient care provided in 1986 to study 36,982 women 65 to 79 years of age, who had local or regional breast cancer and underwent either mastectomy or breast-conserving treatment (local excision, quadrantectomy, or subtotal mastectomy). Information about the hospitals at which these women were treated was obtained from an American Hospital Association survey. RESULTS Of the 36,982 women, 12.1 percent had breast-conserving surgery and 87.9 percent had a mastectomy. The frequency of breast-conserving surgery ranged from 3.5 percent to 21.2 percent in various states. The highest rate of use was in the Middle Atlantic states (20.0 percent) and New England (17.2 percent), and the lowest was in the East South Central states (5.9 percent) and the West South Central states (7.3 percent). Breast-conserving treatment was used more often in urban than in rural areas, in teaching hospitals than in nonteaching hospitals, in large hospitals than in small hospitals, and in hospitals with on-site radiation therapy or geriatric services than in others. Most of the geographic variation persisted after adjustment for the characteristics of hospitals and patients for which data were available. CONCLUSIONS There is substantial geographic variation in the use of breast-conserving surgery, which cannot be explained by differences in hospital characteristics. Hospital characteristics that were independently redictive of greater use of breast-conserving surgery were the size of the metropolitan area, the status of the institution as a teaching hospital, and the availability of radiation therapy and geriatric services.}

We can only speculate from the results of observational studies among compensated cirrhotic patients treated by IFN regimens. In these patients, SVR were obtained mostly by the combination IFN and ribavirin treatments and decreased the occurrence of liver decompensation, of hepatocellular carcinoma and of death [2,3]. The rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence is strongly decreased after SVR but not abolished with an incidence of HCC ranging from 0.4 to 2\% per year after viral eradication [3].},

The outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the WHO on Mar 11, 2020. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterise our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.},

  abstract = {Among the adult organs, liver is unique for its ability to regenerate. A concerted signaling cascade enables optimum initiation of the regeneration process following insults brought about by surgery or a toxicant. Additionally, there exists a cellular redundancy, whereby a transiently amplifying progenitor population appears and expands to ensure regeneration, when differentiated cells of the liver are unable to proliferate in both experimental and clinical scenarios. One such pathway of relevance in these phenomena is Wnt/??-catenin signaling, which is activated relatively early during regeneration mostly through post-translational modifications. Once activated, ??-catenin signaling drives the expression of target genes that are critical for cell cycle progression and contribute to initiation of the regeneration process. The role and regulation of Wnt/??-catenin signaling is now documented in rats, mice, zebrafish and patients. More recently, a regenerative advantage of the livers in ??-catenin overexpressing mice was reported, as was also the case after exogenous Wnt-1 delivery to the liver paving the way for assessing means to stimulate the pathway for therapeutics in liver failure. ??-Catenin is also pertinent in hepatic oval cell activation and differentiation. However, aberrant activation of the Wnt/??-catenin signaling is reported in a significant subset of hepatocellular cancers (HCC). While many mechanisms of such activation have been reported, the most functional means of aberrant and sustained activation is through mutations in the ??-catenin gene or in AXIN1/2, which encodes for a scaffolding protein critical for ??-catenin degradation. Intriguingly, in experimental models hepatic overexpression of normal or mutant ??-catenin is insufficient for tumorigenesis. In fact ??-catenin loss promoted chemical carcinogenesis in the liver due to alternate mechanisms. Since most HCC occur in the backdrop of chronic hepatic injury, where hepatic regeneration is necessary for maintenance of liver function, but at the same time serves as the basis of dysplastic changes, this Promethean attribute exhibits a Jekyll and Hyde behavior that makes distinguishing good regeneration from bad regeneration essential for targeting selective molecular pathways as personalized medicine becomes a norm in clinical practice. Could ??-catenin signaling be one such pathway that may be redundant in regeneration and indispensible in HCC in a subset of cases? ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Location North American spruce-fir forests, Appalachian montane spruce-fir forests. Methods We estimated rates of distance decay through regression of log-transformed compositional similarity against distance for pairwise comparisons of thirty-four white spruce plots and twenty-six black spruce plots distributed from eastern Canada to Alaska, six regional floras along the crest of the Appalachians, and six regional floras along the east--west extent of the boreal forest. Results Similarity decreased significantly with distance, with the most linear models relating the log of similarity to untransformed distance. The rate of similarity decay was 1.5--1.9 times higher for vascular plants than for bryophytes. The rate of distance decay was highest for berry-fruited and nut-bearing species (1.7 times higher than plumose-seeded species and 1.9 times higher than microseeded/spore species) and 2.1 times higher for herbs than woody plants. There was no distance decay for rare species, while species of intermediate frequency had 2.0 times higher distance decay rates than common species. The rate of distance decay was 2.7 times higher for floras from the fragmented Appalachians than for floras from the contiguous boreal forest.},

Uptake is low among patients with a high risk for influenza complications and good access to specialist care, such as recent cancer survivors. We hypothesized that more accessible pharmacies could be associated with higher immunization uptake in such patients. Objectives: To determine whether pharmacy access is associated with influenza vaccination in subjects recently diagnosed with breast cancer, and whether this association differs by additional risk factors for influenza complications. Methods: We examined a cohort of patients with stage 0-III breast cancer diagnosed 20112015 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End ResultseMedicare cancer registry. All retail pharmacies in the United States were identified, and pharmacy access was measured by assessing supply and demand in each census tract using a 2-stage floating catchment area approach that accounted for pharmacy driving distances recommended by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. We examined the association of pharmacy access with influenza vaccination after breast cancer diagnosis in regression models. Results: More than 11\% of 45,722 patients with breast cancer lived in census tracts where no pharmacies were within recommended driving distances from the population-weighted tract center. Vaccination in the year after diagnosis was less likely for patients in these very low eaccess tracts (adjusted odds ratio 0.92 [95\% CI 0.86e0.96]), black (0.55 [0.51e0.60]) and Hispanic (0.76 [0.70e0.83]) women, and Medicaid recipients (0.74 [0.69e0.79]). Vaccination was inversely associated with per capita income in the subject's census tract, but there was no difference in the pharmacy effect by race, ethnicity, or census tract income. Conclusion: Very low pharmacy access is associated with modest reductions in vaccination that could be useful for policy and planning regarding vaccinator resources and outreach. \copyright{} 2021 American Pharmacists Association\textregistered.

METHODS A population-based cohort of postmenopausal women with incident breast cancer aged sixty-five and older was identified from Medicare claims from four states and followed over five years. General health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study SF-12 Health Survey, and breast cancer-related HRQOL was assessed using the breast cancer subscale of the functional assessment of cancer therapy (FACT-B BCS). The association of HRQOL with sociodemographic variables, comorbidity, and breast cancer variables (stage, treatments, and treatment sequelae) was examined in longitudinal models. RESULTS Among the 3083 older breast cancer survivors, general HRQOL as measured by SF-12 mental and physical component scores was similar to norms for non-cancer populations, and remained stable throughout follow-up. Breast cancer treatments, including surgery and radiation, adjuvant hormonal therapy, and cytotoxic chemotherapy were not associated with worsened general health scores. A similar pattern was seen for breast cancer-related HRQOL scores, except that chemotherapy was associated with slightly worse scores. Lymphedema occurred in 17\% of the cohort, and was strongly associated with all measures of HRQOL. Reductions in general HRQOL with lymphedema development were larger than those with an age increase of 10 years. CONCLUSIONS There is little association of breast cancer treatment with HRQOL in older breast cancer patients followed for up to five years, but the development of lymphedema is associated with substantial reductions in HRQOL.},

  abstract = {Despite the recent flourishing of mediation analysis techniques, many modern approaches are difficult to implement or applicable to only a restricted range of regression models. This report provides practical guidance for implementing a new technique utilizing inverse odds ratio weighting (IORW) to estimate natural direct and indirect effects for mediation analyses. IORW takes advantage of the odds ratio's invariance property and condenses information on the odds ratio for the relationship between the exposure (treatment) and multiple mediators, conditional on covariates, by regressing exposure on mediators and covariates. The inverse of the covariate-adjusted exposure-mediator odds ratio association is used to weight the primary analytical regression of the outcome on treatment. The treatment coefficient in such a weighted regression estimates the natural direct effect of treatment on the outcome, and indirect effects are identified by subtracting direct effects from total effects. Weighting renders treatment and mediators independent, thereby deactivating indirect pathways of the mediators. This new mediation technique accommodates multiple discrete or continuous mediators. IORW is easily implemented and is appropriate for any standard regression model, including quantile regression and survival analysis. An empirical example is given using data from the Moving to Opportunity (1994-2002) experiment, testing whether neighborhood context mediated the effects of a housing voucher program on obesity.

Of particular interest is whether alcohol availability varies according to neighborhood racial/ethnic composition once measures of social disorganization (socioeconomic disadvantage, residential instability, and racial/ethnic heterogeneity) are controlled. Using data from the 1990 Census and 1993 alcohol license reports, we estimate a series of negative binomial regression models with corrections for spatial autocorrelation. The results show that percent Asian is associated with lower offsite alcohol outlet density. Once socioeconomic disadvantage is controlled, percent Latino is related to lower alcohol availability. Although similar suppressor patterns are observed, percent Black is generally unrelated to outlet density. Consistent with social disorganization theory, socioeconomic disadvantage and residential instability predict increased alcohol availability. Neighborhood racial/ethnic composition is either unrelated or inversely related to outlet density once social disorganization and other neighborhood characteristics are taken into account. \copyright{} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

SARS-CoV-2 positivity lasted a median of 20.0 days (interquartile range, 12.5--26.25 days). The median time from first positive SARS-CoV-2 test to cellular therapy was 45 days (interquartile range, 37.75--70 days); 1 patient tested positive on the day of infusion. After cellular therapy, no patients had recrudescent SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19--related complications.

Recent advances in understanding the process of blood vessel growth has offered significant tools for therapeutic neovascularization. Several angiogenic growth factors including vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were used for vascularization of ischemic tissues. Three approaches have been used for vascularization of bioengineered tissue: incorporation of angiogenic factors in the bioengineered tissue, seeding endothelial cells with other cell types and prevascularization of matrices prior to cell seeding. This paper reviews the process of blood vessel growth and tissue vascularization, and discuss strategies for efficient vascularization of engineered tissues.},

  abstract = {The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). These trans-membrane proteins are activated following binding with peptide growth factors of the EGF-family of proteins. Evidence suggests that the EGFR is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of different carcinoma types. The EGFR and EGF-like peptides are often over-expressed in human carcinomas, and in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that these proteins are able to induce cell transformation. Amplification of the EGFR gene and mutations of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain have been recently demonstrated to occur in carcinoma patients. Interestingly, both these genetic alterations of the EGFR are correlated with high probability to respond to anti-EGFR agents. However, ErbB proteins and their ligands form a complex system in which the interactions occurring between receptors and ligands affect the type and the duration of the intracellular signals that derive from receptor activation. In fact, proteins of the ErbB family form either homo- or hetero-dimers following ligand binding, each dimer showing different affinity for ligands and different signaling properties. In this regard, evidence suggests that cooperation of multiple ErbB receptors and cognate ligands is necessary to induce cell transformation. In particular, the growth and the survival of carcinoma cells appear to be sustained by a network of receptors/ligands of the ErbB family. This phenomenon is also important for therapeutic approaches, since the response to anti-EGFR agents might depend on the total level of expression of ErbB receptors and ligands in tumor cells.},

The experience of racism is a complex phenomenon that has been found to have negative psychological outcomes in adult studies of African Americans. There has been a gap in the empirical literature regarding the possible associations between perceived racism and children's psychological well-being. This study is an attempt to address that gap. Results demonstrated that experiences of racism were related to self- and parent-reported externalizing symptoms. Personal experiences of racism were related to self-reported internalizing symptoms, lower self-concept, and higher levels of hopelessness. Potential mediators (e.g., trait anger, hostile attribution bias) were analyzed. Additional analyses indicated that trait anger mediated a number of the observed relations between perceived racism and behavioral symptoms. The resuits of the study suggest that perceived racism is associated with multiple negative correlates for African American boys. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {Metformin, one of the most commonly used drugs for patients with type 2 diabetes, recently has received much attention regarding its anti-cancer action. It is thought that the suppression of mTOR signaling is involved in metformin's anti-cancer action. Although liver cancer is one of the most responsive types of cancer for reduction of incidence by metformin, the molecular mechanism of the suppression of mTOR in liver remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the suppressing effect of metformin on mTOR signaling and cell proliferation using human liver cancer cells. Metformin suppressed phosphorylation of p70-S6 kinase, and ribosome protein S6, downstream targets of mTOR, and suppressed cell proliferation. We found that DEPTOR, an endogenous substrate of mTOR suppression, is involved in the suppressing effect of metformin on mTOR signaling and cell proliferation in human liver cancer cells. Metformin increases the protein levels of DEPTOR, intensifies binding to mTOR, and exerts a suppressing effect on mTOR signaling. This increasing effect of DEPTOR by metformin is regulated by the proteasome degradation system; the suppressing effect of metformin on mTOR signaling and cell proliferation is in a DEPTOR-dependent manner. Furthermore, metformin exerts a suppressing effect on proteasome activity, DEPTOR-related mTOR signaling, and cell proliferation in an AMPK-dependent manner. We conclude that DEPTOR-related mTOR suppression is involved in metformin's anti-cancer action in liver, and could be a novel target for anti-cancer therapy.},

  abstract = {Introduction Mass malaria vaccination, rather than vaccinating only children below age 5, has been proven to have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality among those vaccinated, both young and old. Addressing vaccine scepticism and misinformation is crucial in African nations to build public trust in malaria prevention. Therefore, including a wider range of demographics in vaccine trials is necessary for equitable representation and achieving herd immunity against malaria. Aim This present article aims to identify some of the obstacles that impede malaria vaccination usage and acceptability in African Nations in combating malaria in the region as it continues to pose a significant global public health problem. Methodology A literature search was done on the Malaria vaccine between 2000 and 2023. Past and present articles/studies on this topic were consulted on PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science using the following keywords; ``Malaria,'' ``Vaccines,'' ``African Nations,'' ``Obstacles, Strategies,'' and ``Public Health.'' Results The recently approved RTS, S/AS01, and R21/Matrix-M™ Malaria vaccines have the potential to prevent numerous deaths and cases of Malaria in Africa. These vaccines Malaria vaccines are cost-effective in African areas with moderate to high plasmodium falciparum and can be delivered through routine immunization. Conclusion To combat malaria effectively in African Nations, African leaders need to set up a comprehensive approach that involves; prevention, healthcare access, implementation research strategies towards adoption and acceptance of malaria vaccines in Africa as well as community engagement with the religious leaders, the market women, community heads, schools, as well as students' union towards the willingness and acceptability of the malaria vaccines among the African populations.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study was conducted within the New York University Langone Health system, which includes over 260 outpatient practices and 4 acute care hospitals. All patients within the system's integrated health record who were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between March 1, 2020, and April 8, 2020, were identified and followed up through May 13, 2020. Data were analyzed in June 2020. Among 11 547 patients tested, outcomes were compared by race and ethnicity and examined against differences by age, sex, body mass index, comorbidity, insurance type, and neighborhood socioeconomic status. EXPOSURES Race and ethnicity categorized using self-reported electronic health record data (ie, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Asian, and multiracial/other patients). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The likelihood of receiving a positive test, hospitalization, and critical illness (defined as a composite of care in the intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, discharge to hospice, or death). RESULTS Among 9722 patients (mean [SD] age, 50.7 [17.5] years; 58.8\% women), 4843 (49.8\%) were positive for COVID-19; 2623 (54.2\%) of those were admitted for hospitalization (1047 [39.9\%] White, 375 [14.3\%] Black, 715 [27.3\%] Hispanic, 180 [6.9\%] Asian, 207 [7.9\%] multiracial/other). In fully adjusted models, Black patients (odds ratio [OR], 1.3; 95\% CI, 1.2-1.6) and Hispanic patients (OR, 1.5; 95\% CI, 1.3-1.7) were more likely than White patients to test positive. Among those who tested positive, odds of hospitalization were similar among White, Hispanic, and Black patients, but higher among Asian (OR, 1.6, 95\% CI, 1.1-2.3) and multiracial patients (OR, 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.0-1.9) compared with White patients. Among those hospitalized, Black patients were less likely than White patients to have severe illness (OR, 0.6; 95\% CI, 0.4-0.8) and to die or be discharged to hospice (hazard ratio, 0.7; 95\% CI, 0.6-0.9).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The favourable effects of coffee on liver enzymes have been reported worldwide. This study investigated the association between coffee consumption and serum aminotransferase concentration in Korean adults. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN Data were obtained from the fourth and fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentration were defined as {$>$}30 IU/L for men and {$>$}19 IU/L for women. The risk of elevated ALT and AST according to general characteristics and frequency of coffee consumption were tested by chi-square tests and multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS The prevalence of elevated ALT was 27.4\%, 27.8\%, and 26.9\% in subjects who drank {$<$}1, 1, and {$>$}=2 times/day, respectively. The proportions of individuals with elevated AST were 32.5\%, 33.1\%, and 26.7\% in subjects who drank {$<$}1, 1, and {$>$}=2 times/day, respectively. The aORs for elevated ALT and AST were significantly lower in subjects who drank {$>$}=2 times of coffee/day than in those who drank {$<$}1 time/day (ALT: aOR=0.86, 95\% CI=0.79-0.94; AST: aOR=0.83, 95\% CI=0.76-0.91). In subgroup analysis, consumption of {$>$}=2 times/day was associated with lower ORs for elevated ALT in the high-risk group overall and in the viral hepatitis and obesity subgroups, respectively. In sensitivity analysis, reduced frequency of coffee consumption was associated with an increased risk for elevated liver enzymes, although an association between coffee consumption and elevated ALT was not observed in women or current smokers. CONCLUSIONS Higher coffee consumption was associated with lower risk of elevated aminotransferase concentration in Korean adults.},

  abstract = {Several studies have reported the role of coffee for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, no study investigated about the relation of coffee for HCC among individuals with a relevant risk factor, i.e., hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Thus, we conducted a hospital-based case-control study to assess an association between coffee and HCC, in which both 73 cases and 253 controls were patients with chronic type C liver disease. To consider potential changes in coffee intake due to progression of liver disease, the effect of coffee was estimated separately before and after first identification of liver disease. Odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for HCC risk were calculated using the conditional logistic regression model. Coffee drinking on a daily basis ({$>$}/=1cup/day) revealed lowered ORs as compared with non-drinkers both before first identification of liver disease (OR 0.38; 95\% CI: 0.13-1.12; P=0.078) as well as thereafter (OR 0.19; 95\% CI: 0.05-0.71; P=0.032). Even after excluding subjects who reported a reduction in the frequency of coffee intake after first identification of liver disease, this negative correlation persisted (OR 0.35; 95\% CI: 0.12-1.06; P=0.063).

However, few cohort studies have incorporated, in a strict and in-depth manner, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections or investigated synergism between such factors. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study using sera stored before hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis in the longitudinal cohort of atomic bomb survivors. The study included 224 hepatocellular carcinoma cases and 644 controls that were matched to the cases on gender, age, city, time of serum storage, and method of serum storage, and countermatched on radiation dose. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that HBV and HCV infections, alcohol consumption, smoking habit, body mass index (BMI), and diabetes mellitus were associated with increased hepatocellular carcinoma risk, whereas coffee drinking was associated with decreased hepatocellular carcinoma risk. Multivariate relative risks of hepatocellular carcinoma (95\% confidence interval) were 45.8 (15.2-138), 101 (38.7-263), 70.7 (8.3-601), 4.36 (1.48-13.0), and 4.57 (1.85-11.3), for HBV infection alone, HCV infection alone, both HBV and HCV infections, alcohol consumption of {$>$} or =40 g of ethanol per day, and BMI of {$>$}25.0 kg/m(2) 10 years before diagnosis, respectively. HBV and HCV infection and BMI of {$>$}25.0 kg/m(2) remained independent risk factors even after adjusting for severity of liver fibrosis. Among HCV-infected individuals, the relative risk of hepatocellular carcinoma for a 1 kg/m(2) increase in BMI was 1.39 (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: To limit the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, control of excess weight may be crucial for individuals with chronic liver disease, especially those with chronic hepatitis C.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical need for accurate epidemic forecasting to predict pathogen spread and evolution, anticipate healthcare challenges, and evaluate intervention strategies. The reliability of these forecasts hinges on detailed knowledge of disease transmission across different population segments, which may be inferred from within-community transmission rates via proxy data, such as contact surveys and mobility data. However, these approaches are indirect, making it difficult to accurately estimate rare transmissions between socially or geographically distant communities. We show that the steep ramp up of genome sequencing surveillance during the pandemic can be leveraged to             directly             identify transmission patterns between communities. Specifically, our approach uses a hidden Markov model to infer the fraction of infections a community imports from other communities based on how rapidly the allele frequencies in the focal community converge to those in the donor communities. Applying this method to SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data from England and the U.S., we uncover networks of inter-community disease transmission that, while broadly reflecting geographical relationships, also expose epidemiologically significant long-range interactions. We provide evidence that transmission between regions can substantially change between waves of variants of concern, both in magnitude and direction, and analyze how the inferred plasticity and heterogeneity in inter-community transmission impact evolutionary forecasts. Overall, our study high-lights population genomic time series data as a crucial record of epidemiological interactions, which can be deciphered using tree-free inference methods.},

Here, we jointly analyze SARSCoV-2 genomic and paired epidemiologic data from LTCFs and surrounding communities in Washington state (WA) to assess transmission patterns during 2020--2022, in a setting of changing policy. We describe sequencing efforts and genomic epidemiologic findings across LTCFs and perform in-depth analysis in a single county. Methods We assessed genomic data representativeness, built phylogenetic trees, and conducted discrete trait analysis to estimate introduction sizes over time, and explored selected outbreaks to further characterize transmission events. Results We found that transmission dynamics among cases associated with LTCFs in WA changed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, with variable introduction rates into LTCFs, but decreasing amplification within LTCFs. SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in LTCFs were similar to those circulating in communities at the same time. Transmission between staff and residents was bi-directional. Conclusions Understanding transmission dynamics within and between LTCFs using genomic epidemiology on a broad scale can assist in targeting policies and prevention efforts. Tracking facility-level outbreaks can help differentiate intra-facility outbreaks from high community transmission with repeated introduction events. Based on our study findings, methods for routine tree building and overlay of epidemiologic data for hypothesis generation by public health practitioners are recommended. Discrete trait analysis added valuable insight and can be considered when representative sequencing is performed. Cluster detection tools, especially those that rely on distance thresholds, may be of more limited use given current data capture and timeliness. Importantly, we noted a decrease in data capture from LTCFs over time. Depending on goals for use of genomic data, sentinel surveillance should be increased or targeted surveillance implemented to ensure available data for analysis.},

  abstract = {Quantitative indices of residential segregation have been with us for half a century, but suffer significant limitations. While useful for comparison among regions, summary indices fail to reveal spatial aspects of segregation. Such measures generally consider only the population mix within zones, not between them. Zone boundaries are treated as impenetrable barriers to interaction between population subgroups, so that measurement of segregation is constrained by the zoning system, which bears no necessary relation to interaction among population subgroups. A segregation measurement approach less constrained by the chosen zoning system, which enables visualization of segregation levels at the local scale and accounts for the spatial dimension of segregation, is required. We propose a kernel density estimation approach to model spatial aspects of segregation. This provides an explicitly geographical framework for modeling and visualizing local spatial segregation. The density estimation approach lends itself to development of an index of spatial segregation with the advantage of functional compatibility with the most widely used index of segregation (the dissimilarity index D). We provide a short review of the literature on measuring segregation, briefly describe the kernel density estimation method, and illustrate how the method can be used for measuring segregation. Examples using a simulated landscape and two empirical cases in Washington, DC and Philadelphia, PA are presented.},

A binomial logic model is estimated which predicts the likelihood that a commuter will choose transit rather than auto for a commute trip based on aggregate characteristics of the surrounding area. Variables in this model include demographic factors as well as detailed accessibility calculations for both transit and auto. The mode achieves a {$\rho$}2 value of 0.597, and analysis of the results suggests that continuous accessibility of transit systems may be a valuable tool for use in modeling and forecasting.},

In cells of many organisms glucose ensures its own efficient metabolism by serving as an environmental stimulus that regulates the quantity, types, and activity of glucose transporters, both at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels. This is most apparent in the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has 20 genes encoding known or likely glucose transporters, each of which is known or likely to have a different affinity for glucose. The expression and function of most of these HXT genes is regulated by different levels of glucose. This review focuses on the mechanisms S. cerevisiae and a few other fungal species utilize for sensing the level of glucose and transmitting this information to the nucleus to alter HXT gene expression. One mechanism represses transcription of some HXT genes when glucose levels are high and works through the Mig1 transcriptional repressor, whose function is regulated by the Snf1-Snf4 protein kinase and Reg1-Glc7 protein phosphatase. Another pathway induces HXT expression in response to glucose and employs the Rgt1 transcriptional repressor, a ubiquitin ligase protein complex (SCF(Grr1)) that regulates Rgt1 function, and two glucose sensors in the membrane (Snf3 and Rgt2) that bind glucose and generate the intracellular signal to which Rgt1 responds. These two regulatory pathways collaborate with other, less well-understood, pathways to ensure that yeast cells express the glucose transporters best suited for the amount of glucose available.},

  abstract = {How eukaryotic cells sense availability of glucose, their preferred carbon and energy source, is an important, unsolved problem. Bakers' yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) uses two glucose transporter homologs, Snf3 and Rgt2, as glucose sensors that generate a signal for induction of expression of genes encoding hexose transporters (HXT genes). We present evidence that these proteins generate an intracellular glucose signal without transporting glucose. The Snf3 and Rgt2 glucose sensors contain unusually long C-terminal tails that are predicted to be in the cytoplasm. These tails appear to be the signaling domains of Snf3 and Rgt2 because they are necessary for glucose signaling by Snf3 and Rgt2, and transplantation of the C-terminal tail of Snf3 onto the Hxt1 and Hxt2 glucose transporters converts them into glucose sensors that can generate a signal for glucose-induced HXT gene expression. These results support the idea that yeast senses glucose using two modified glucose transporters that serve as glucose receptors.},

  abstract = {This report provides new CDC recommendations for tests that can support a diagnosis of syphilis, including serologic testing and methods for the identification of the causative agent Treponema pallidum. These comprehensive recommendations are the first published by CDC on laboratory testing for syphilis, which has traditionally been based on serologic algorithms to detect a humoral immune response to T. pallidum. These tests can be divided into nontreponemal and treponemal tests depending on whether they detect antibodies that are broadly reactive to lipoidal antigens shared by both host and T. pallidum or antibodies specific to T. pallidum, respectively. Both types of tests must be used in conjunction to help distinguish between an untreated infection or a past infection that has been successfully treated. Newer serologic tests allow for laboratory automation but must be used in an algorithm, which also can involve older manual serologic tests. Direct detection of T. pallidum continues to evolve from microscopic examination of material from lesions for visualization of T. pallidum to molecular detection of the organism. Limited point-of-care tests for syphilis are available in the United States; increased availability of point-of-care tests that are sensitive and specific could facilitate expansion of screening programs and reduce the time from test result to treatment. These recommendations are intended for use by clinical laboratory directors, laboratory staff, clinicians, and disease control personnel who must choose among the multiple available testing methods, establish standard operating procedures for collecting and processing specimens, interpret test results for laboratory reporting, and counsel and treat patients. Future revisions to these recommendations will be based on new research or technologic advancements for syphilis clinical laboratory science.},

Data from 293 studies reported in 333 articles pub- lished between 1983 and 2013, and conducted predominately in the U.S., were analysed using random effects models and mean weighted effect sizes. Racism was associated with poorer mental health (negative mental health: r = -.23, 95\% CI [-.24,-.21], k = 227; positive mental health: r = -.13, 95\% CI [-.16,-.10], k = 113), including depression, anxiety, psycho- logical stress and various other outcomes. Racism was also associated with poorer general health (r = -.13 (95\% CI [-.18,-.09], k = 30), and poorer physical health (r = -.09, 95\% CI [-.12,-.06], k = 50). Moderation effects were found for some outcomes with regard to study and exposure characteristics. Effect sizes of racism on mental health were stronger in cross-sectional compared with longitudinal data and in non-representative samples com- pared with representative samples. Age, sex, birthplace and education level did not moder- ate the effects of racismon health. Ethnicity significantly moderated the effect of racism on negative mental health and physical health: the association between racismand negative mental health was significantly stronger for Asian American and Latino(a) American partici- pants compared with African American participants, and the association between racism and physical health was significantly stronger for Latino(a) American participants compared with African American participants.}

We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled between February 2020 and March 2022 jointly with epidemiological and cell phone mobility data to investigate fine scale spatiotemporal SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in King County, Washington, a diverse, metropolitan US county. We applied an approximate structured coalescent approach to model transmission within and between North King County and South King County alongside the rate of outside introductions into the county. Our phylodynamic analyses reveal that following stay-at-home orders, the epidemic trajectories of North and South King County began to diverge. We find that South King County consistently had more reported and estimated cases, COVID-19 hospitalizations, and longer persistence of local viral transmission when compared to North King County, where viral importations from outside drove a larger proportion of new cases. Using mobility and demographic data, we also find that South King County experienced a more modest and less sustained reduction in mobility following stay-at-home orders than North King County, while also bearing more socioeconomic inequities that might contribute to a disproportionate burden of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Overall, our findings suggest a role for local-scale phylodynamics in understanding the heterogeneous transmission landscape.},

Allostatic load, a composite score of biomarkers representing physiologic dysregulation, may serve as a measure of the biological burden of breast cancer. This study investigates the association between breast cancer and allostatic load scores by comparing allostatic load scores in those with a history of breast cancer to those without, stratified by race. METHODS: Black and white women aged 35 to 85 were analyzed using the data from NHANES 1999-2008 (n = 4875 women, of which 188 women had a history of breast cancer). Stratified by race, we ran multivariate analyses with history of breast cancer as a predictor for elevated allostatic load while adjusting for other potentially confounding variables. RESULTS: Although a history of breast cancer was not associated with elevated allostatic load in white women, it was significantly associated with elevated allostatic load in black women after adjusting for age, income, education, insurance type, smoking status, alcohol intake, and physical activity [Odds Ratio (OR) 2.08 (95\%CI 1.02, 4.22)]. Furthermore, an interaction between black and having a history of breast cancer was found to be significant in predicting elevated allostatic load scores after adjusting for demographic, behavioral, and comorbidity characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the biological toll of breast cancer may be greater in black women than white women.},

Some countries like India have a low incidence despite having a large burden of chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and C virus (HCV) infection. We hypothesized that long-term iron deficiency could attenuate the hepatic inflammation and lead to a lower incidence of HCC in India than expected. METHODS: We evaluated the association of serum ferritin levels and HCC in Indian patients with HBV- or HCV-related chronic liver disease (CLD) using a case-control study design. We enrolled 141 patients with HCC (cases) and 240 patients having chronic HBV or HCV infection-related CLD (controls). Study participants were grouped on the basis of ferritin values into low-normal, high-normal, and high subgroups. RESULTS: Mean ferritin values were higher in cases as compared to controls (425.8 vs. 135.6 ng/mL, p = 0.000). A significant dose-response effect for serum ferritin levels and HCC was seen with an odds ratio (95 \% confidence interval) of 3.0 (1.6-5.9, p = 0.001) for subjects with high-normal ferritin levels and 8.2 (4.1-16.5, p = 0.000) for subjects with high ferritin levels in a multivariate model. Other significant independent risk factors in the multivariate model included older age, male gender, alcohol and tobacco use, elevated alanine aminotransferase, higher family income, and coffee drinking. CONCLUSION: We found an independent association between serum ferritin levels and HCC in patients with CLD of viral etiology. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm the hypothesis that iron deficiency protects against HCC in CLD.},

A secondary aim was to evaluate different statistical approaches to analyzing variation in validity estimates. METHODS: Literature searches and personal inquiries identified 26 published reports containing 51 comparisons between self-reported behavior and biochemical measures. The sensitivity and specificity of self-reports of smoking were calculated for each study as measures of accuracy. RESULTS: Sensitivity ranged from 6\% to 100\% (mean = 87.5\%), and specificity ranged from 33\% to 100\% (mean = 89.2\%). Interviewer-administered questionnaires, observational studies, reports by adults, and biochemical validation with cotinine plasma were associated with higher estimates of sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reports of smoking are accurate in most studies. To improve accuracy, biochemical assessment, preferably with cotinine plasma, should be considered in intervention studies and student populations.},

In some cases, the concentrated phase shows the presence of structured liquid crystal phases, such as hexagonally ordered cylinders or lamellae. The solubility in the solvent and the nature of the organic group belonging to the hybrid particles are key aspects affecting the driving force for the phase separation, hence the concentration of surfactant in the phases at equilibrium. Biphasic regions have also generally been detected by applying the quasichemical theory, which employs a lattice-based mean field approximation. Good quantitative agreement with the results obtained from the simulations was typically found, especially when no self-assembly into ordered aggregates was observed.},

Prescription drug abuse is the fastest growing drug problem in the United States. The increase in unintentional drug overdose death rates in recent years has been driven by increased use of a class of prescription drugs called opioid analgesics. Since 2003, more overdose deaths have involved opioid analgesics than heroin and cocaine combined. In addition, for every unintentional overdose death related to an opioid analgesic, nine persons are admitted for substance abuse treatment, 35 visit emergency departments, 161 report drug abuse or dependence, and 461 report nonmedical uses of opioid analgesics. Implementing strategies that target those persons at greatest risk will require strong coordination and collaboration at the federal, state, local, and tribal levels, as well as engagement of parents, youth influencers, health-care professionals, and policy-makers.},

  abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is a major human and veterinary pathogen worldwide. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) poses a significant and enduring problem to the treatment of infection by such strains. Resistance is usu-ally conferred by the acquisition of a nonnative gene encoding a penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a), with significantly lower affinity for {$\beta$}-lactams. This resistance allows cell-wall biosynthesis, the target of {$\beta$}-lactams, to continue even in the presence of typically inhibitory concentrations of antibiotic. PBP2a is encoded by the mecA gene, which is carried on a distinct mobile ge-netic element (SCCmec), the expression of which is controlled through a pro-teolytic signal transduction pathway comprising a sensor protein (MecR1) and a repressor (MecI). Many of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms underlying methicillin resistance in S. aureus have been elucidated, including regulatory events and the structure of key proteins. Here we review recent advances in this area.},

This account describes some first-hand experiences of the aftermath of the Rwandan Civil War of 1994. Events leading to the conflict are described, eye witness accounts of child trauma during the war are recorded and the medical problems (currently ongoing) affecting children are described. Over a period of 3 months from April to June 1994, between half and one million Rwandese, a significant proportion of them women and children, were murdered in brutal hand-to-hand killing, dying from close-quarter gunshot and machete slaughter. Nearly half of the population became refugees in neighbouring countries or displaced persons in their own land. UNAMIR II, the United Nations Emergency Humanitarian Response, grew to some 7000 persons by May 1995. Medical aid was provided by emergency medical contingents from the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, the latter through its Australian Medical Support Force, providing the definitive emergency medical infrastructure from August 1994. In the consequent post-war civil and social disruption, children suffered from burns, cholera and from motor vehicle trauma. Ongoing landmine blasts continue to affect children and adolescents especially. A new international humanitarian code to build a time-expiry device into landmines and other similar ordinance is urgently required as the post-conflict ongoing disasters in Rwanda, Afghanistan and Cambodia illustrate. Current problems affecting children include an increasing risk of HIV infection, trauma and the special humanitarian needs of thousands of orphans.},

Previous studies have shown that alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) genes and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) genes may affect the risk of development of alcohol dependence, and that polymorphisms within these genes may differentially affect risk for the disorder depending on the ethnic group evaluated. We evaluated variations in the ADH and ALDH genes in a large study investigating risk factors for substance use in a NA population. We assessed ancestry admixture and tested for associations between alcohol-related phenotypes in the genomic regions around the ADH1-7 and ALDH2 and ALDH1A1 genes. Seventy-two ADH variants showed significant evidence of association with a severity level of alcohol drinking-related dependence symptoms phenotype. These significant variants spanned across the entire 7 ADH gene cluster regions. Two significant associations, one in ADH and one in ALDH2, were observed with alcohol dependence diagnosis. Seventeen variants showed significant association with the largest number of alcohol drinks ingested during any 24-hour period. Variants in or near ADH7 were significantly negatively associated with alcohol-related phenotypes, suggesting a potential protective effect of this gene. In addition, our results suggested that a higher degree of NA ancestry is associated with higher frequencies of potential risk variants and lower frequencies of potential protective variants for alcohol dependence phenotypes.},

In the present article, we describe the construction of a novel porous alginate scaffold that incorporates tiny poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres capable of controlling the release of angiogenic factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The microspheres are an integral part of the solid alginate matrix, and their incorporation does not affect the scaffold porosity or pore size. In vitro, bFGF was released from the porous composite scaffolds in a controlled manner and it was biologically active as assessed by its ability to induce the proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts. The controlled delivery of bFGF from the three-dimensional scaffolds accelerated the matrix vascularization after implantation on the mesenteric membrane in rat peritoneum. The number of penetrating capillaries into the bFGF-releasing scaffolds was nearly fourfold higher than into the control scaffolds (those incorporating microspheric BSA and heparin but not bFGF). At day 10 posttransplantation, capillary density in the composite scaffolds was 45 +/- 3/mm(2) and it increased to 70 +/- 7/mm(2) by day 21. The released bFGF induced the formation of large and matured blood vessels, as judged by the massive layer of mural cells surrounding the endothelial cells. The control over bFGF delivery and localizing its effects to areas of need, may aid in the wider application of bFGF in therapeutic angiogenesis as well as in tissue engineering.},

This is the first study in this field combining a prospective design with an adequate control group. Potential donors served as a control group because they also had a relative in need of a liver transplant and were as emotionally involved with the recipient as actual donors, but they were not subjected to the donor operation. Groups did not differ in age, gender, marital status, donor-recipient relationship, urgency of transplantation, or recipient group (adult versus child). Actual donors showed decreased physical QOL, whereas potential donors were not affected. However, for both groups, a decrease in anxiety was found. Furthermore, actual donors showed a better mental QOL postoperatively than potential donors. The recipients of these 2 groups did not differ with respect to postoperative complications. Furthermore, the groups did not report a different caregiver burden, but actual donors showed higher self-esteem. Because of the surgery, the worsening of physical symptoms in actual donors was expected. It is remarkable, however, that although actual donors still showed a limited physical QOL 3 months after the operation, in both groups, a similar reduction in anxiety could be observed, and actual donors even demonstrated a better mental QOL postoperatively than potential donors. The latter might be due to a psychological benefit that actual donors derived from the fact that they were able to help the recipients.},

  abstract = {Typhoid fever, caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi, is an endemic cause of febrile disease in Cambodia. The aim of this study was to better understand the epidemiology of pediatric typhoid fever in Cambodia. We accessed routine blood culture data from Angkor Hospital for Children (AHC) in Siem Reap province between 2007 and 2014, and performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) on the isolated bacteria to characterize the S. Typhi population. The resulting phylogenetic information was combined with conventional epidemiological approaches to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of S. Typhi and populationlevel risk factors for reported disease. During the study period, there were 262 cases of typhoid within a 100 km radius of AHC, with a median patient age of 8.2 years (IQR: 5.1--11.5 years). The majority of infections occurred during the rainy season, and commune incidences as high as 11.36/1,000 in children aged {$<$}15 years were observed over the study period. A population-based risk factor analysis found that access to water within households and increasing distance from Tonle Sap Lake were protective. Spatial mapping and WGS provided additional resolution for these findings, and confirmed that proximity to the lake was associated with discrete spatiotemporal disease clusters. We confirmed the dominance of MDR H58 S. Typhi in this population, and found substantial evidence of diversification (at least seven sublineages) within this single lineage. We conclude that there is a substantial burden of pediatric typhoid fever in rural communes in Cambodia. Our data provide a platform for additional population-based typhoid fever studies in this location, and suggest that this would be a suitable setting in which to introduce a school-based vaccination programme with Vi conjugate vaccines.},

  abstract = {The causes of sporadic human cancer are seldom recognized, but it is estimated that carcinogen exposure and chronic inflammation are two important underlying conditions for tumour development, the latter accounting for approximately 20\% of human cancer. Whereas the causal relationship between carcinogen exposure and cancer has been intensely investigated, the molecular and cellular mechanisms linking chronic inflammation to tumorigenesis remain largely unresolved. We proposed that activation of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), a hallmark of inflammatory responses that is frequently detected in tumours, may constitute a missing link between inflammation and cancer. To test this hypothesis, we studied the Mdr2-knockout mouse strain, which spontaneously develops cholestatic hepatitis followed by hepatocellular carcinoma, a prototype of inflammation-associated cancer. We monitored hepatitis and cancer progression in Mdr2-knockout mice, and here we show that the inflammatory process triggers hepatocyte NF-kappaB through upregulation of tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in adjacent endothelial and inflammatory cells. Switching off NF-kappaB in mice from birth to seven months of age, using a hepatocyte-specific inducible IkappaB-super-repressor transgene, had no effect on the course of hepatitis, nor did it affect early phases of hepatocyte transformation. By contrast, suppressing NF-kappaB inhibition through anti-TNFalpha treatment or induction of IkappaB-super-repressor in later stages of tumour development resulted in apoptosis of transformed hepatocytes and failure to progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. Our studies thus indicate that NF-kappaB is essential for promoting inflammation-associated cancer, and is therefore a potential target for cancer prevention in chronic inflammatory diseases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The accuracy of cancer survival statistics relies on the quality of death linkages and follow-up information collected by population-based cancer registries. Methodological issues on survival data by race-ethnicity in the United States, in particular for Hispanics and Asians, have not been well studied and may undermine our understanding of survival disparities.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: Based on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-18 data, we analyzed existing biases in survival statistics when comparing the four largest racial-ethnic groups in the United States, whites, blacks, Hispanics and Asians. We compared the "reported alive" method for calculation of survival, which is appropriate when date of last alive contact is available for all cases, with the "presumed alive" method used when dates of last contact are unavailable. Cox regression was applied to calculate the likelihood of incomplete follow-up (those with less than 5 years of vital status information) according to racial-ethnic group and stage of diagnosis. Finally, potentially missed deaths were estimated based on the numbers of cases with incomplete follow-up for highly fatal cancers.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: The presumed alive method overestimated survival compared with the reported alive method by as much as 0.9-6.2 percentage points depending on the cancer site among Hispanics and by 0.4-2.7 percentage points among Asians. In SEER data, Hispanics and Asians are more likely to have incomplete follow-up than whites or blacks. The assumption of random censoring across race-ethnicity is not met, as among non-white cases, those who have a worse prognosis are more likely to have incomplete follow-up than those with a better prognosis (P {$<$} .05). Moreover, death ascertainment is not equal across racial-ethnic groups. Overall, 3\% of cancer deaths were missed among Hispanics and Asians compared with less than 0.5\% among blacks and whites.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Cancer survival studies involving Hispanics and Asians should be interpreted with caution because the current available data overtly inflates survival in these populations. Censoring is clearly nonrandom across race-ethnicity meaning that findings of Hispanic and Asian survival advantages may be biased. Problematic death linkages among Hispanics and Asians contribute to missing deaths and overestimated survival. More complete follow-up with at least 5 years of information on vital status as well as improved death linkages will decisively increase the validity of survival estimates for these growing populations.},

The validity of the results of mathematical modelling analyses that rely on secondary data sources critically depends on the model(s) employed in the analyses and the parameter values used to populate the models. A recent article in the International Journal of Drug Policy by Andresen and Boyd (2010: 70-76) utilised four different mathematical models of injection-related HIV transmission to estimate the number of HIV infections prevented by Vancouver Canada's Insite supervised injection facility (SIF). The present article reviews and critiques the mathematical models utilised in the Andresen and Boyd article, then describes an alternative-and potentially more accurate-method for estimating the impact of the Insite SIF. This model indicates that the SIF prevents approximately 5-6 infections per year, with a plausible range of 4-8 prevented infections. These estimates are far smaller than suggested by Andresen and Boyd (19-57 prevented infections). ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Very limited information is available about the probability of transmission during acute HIV infection. We conducted a secondary analysis of published data from the Rakai, Uganda seroconversion study. Mathematical and computer-based models were used to quantify the per-act and per-partnership transmission probabilities during acute and chronic HIV infection, and to estimate how many of the transmission events reported in the Rakai study were due to acute-phase HIV transmission. The average per-act transmission probability during acute infection equaled 0.03604 vs. 0.00084 for chronic HIV infection. Overall, HIV was transmitted during acute infection in 46.5\% of 23 "incident index partner couples." Acute-phase transmission accounted for 89.1\% of all transmission events in the first 20 months of follow-up.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fatal heroin overdose is a significant cause of mortality for injection drug users (IDUs). Many of these deaths are preventable because opiate overdoses can be quickly and safely reversed through the injection of Naloxone [brand name Narcan], a prescription drug used to revive persons who have overdosed on heroin or other opioids. Currently, in several cities in the United States, drug users are being trained in naloxone administration and given naloxone for immediate and successful reversals of opiate overdoses. There has been very little formal description of the challenges faced in the development and implementation of large-scale IDU naloxone administration training and distribution programs and the lessons learned during this process. METHODS: During a one year period, over 1,000 participants were trained in SKOOP (Skills and Knowledge on Opiate Prevention) and received a prescription for naloxone by a medical doctor on site at a syringe exchange program (SEP) in New York City. Participants in SKOOP were over the age of 18, current participants of SEPs, and current or former drug users. We present details about program design and lessons learned during the development and implementation of SKOOP. Lessons learned described in the manuscript are collectively articulated by the evaluators and implementers of the project. RESULTS: There were six primary challenges and lessons learned in developing, implementing, and evaluating SKOOP. These include a) political climate surrounding naloxone distribution; b) extant prescription drug laws; c) initial low levels of recruitment into the program; d) development of participant appropriate training methodology; e) challenges in the design of a suitable formal evaluation; and f) evolution of program response to naloxone. CONCLUSION: Other naloxone distribution programs may anticipate similar challenges to SKOOP and we identify mechanisms to address them. Strategies include being flexible in program planning and implementation, developing evaluation instruments for feasibility and simplicity, and responding to and incorporating feedback from participants.},

Regions with rates of carriage over 8\% are commonly considered as "high endemicity" regions. HB carriers have a very significant lifetime risk of developing chronic liver diseases such as cirrhosis and/or liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC). An efficient HB vaccine is available since the early eighties and has been used since for universal infant vaccination in regions of high endemicity. Observations from Taiwan, where universal infant vaccination was introduced from 1984, show a remarkable, long-lasting protection against carriage and reduction of HCC rates in adolescent and young adults born after the initiation of the programme. Two population-based trials have been set up in the mid-eighties to evaluate lifelong protective effects of infant HB vaccine against liver cancer, in The Gambia (West Africa) and in the area of Qidong, China. In other high-endemicity regions of Asia and Africa, universal infants vaccination has consistently showed a long-lasting high protection against chronic carriage and this is expected to lead to a dramatic decrease of chronic liver disease and liver cancer within the next decades. Here we briefly review the lessons of vaccination programmes and trials in high-endemicity regions, based on data gathered during 15-20 years of implementation. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The black/white poverty-rate ratio for each SMSA was a stronger predictor of variation in the black/white mortality ratio for men than for women. For both men and women age 15-44, the level of black/white residential segregation was a significant (positive) predictor of the black/white ratio of the age-standardized death rate. This analysis also identifies SMSAs containing geographic areas with unusually high or low black/white mortality ratios, and indicates the need for more-detailed studies of explanations for such variation.},

Limited data exist on the variability and characteristics of infection that determine disease progression risk within U.S. Asian ethnic subgroups.METHODS: Retrospective analyses were conducted on a large, community-based HBV screening and treatment program in New York City (NYC). From 2004 to 2008, the program enrolled 7,272 Asian-born individuals. Determinants of HBV seroprevalence were calculated and risk factors for HCC progression were compared across Asian subgroups.RESULTS: Among newly tested individuals, 13\% were HBV positive. Seroprevalence varied significantly with age, gender, education, birthplace, and family history of infection. Chinese-born individuals, particularly from the Fujian province, had the highest seroprevalence (23.2\% and 33.1\%, respectively). Clinical and virologic characteristics placed HBV-infected individuals at significant risk for HCC. Significant differences in HCC risk existed among Asian subgroups in bivariate analysis, including age, gender, HBV viral load, and HBeAg status. Differences in HBV genotype and family history of HCC may further HCC risk among subgroups.CONCLUSIONS: Asian immigrants in NYC have a high prevalence of HBV infection and are at significant risk of disease progression and HCC. Although heterogeneity in HBV seroprevalence was found by Asian subgroups, HCC risk among infected individuals was primarily explained by age and gender differences. Country and province of birth, age, and gender may further explain seroprevalence differences.IMPACT: Findings provide estimates of HBV burden in Asian ethnic subgroups and identify high-risk groups to target for screening and treatment that can prevent HCC.},

  abstract = {It is estimated that the city of S\~ao Paulo has over 2.5 million dogs and 560 thousand cats. These populations are irregularly distributed throughout the territory, making it difficult to appropriately allocate health services focused on these species. To reasonably allocate vaccination sites, it is necessary to identify social groups and their access to the referred service. Rabies in dogs and cats has been an important zoonotic health issue in S\~ao Paulo and the key component of rabies control is vaccination. The present study aims to introduce an approach to quantify the potential spatial accessibility to the vaccination sites of the 2009 campaign against rabies in the city of S\~ao Paulo and solve the overestimation associated with the classic methodology that applies buffer zones around vaccination sites based on Euclidean (straight-line) distance. To achieve this, a Gaussian-based two-step floating catchment area method with a travel-friction coefficient was adapted in a geographic information system environment, using distances along a street network based on Dijkstra's algorithm (short path method). The choice of the distance calculation method affected the results in terms of the population covered. In general, areas with low accessibility for both dogs and cats were observed, especially in densely populated areas. The eastern zone of the city had higher accessibility values compared with peripheral and central zones. The Gaussian-based two-step floating catchment method with a travel-friction coefficient was used to assess the overestimation of the straight-line distance method, which is the most widely used method for coverage analysis. We conclude that this approach has the potential to improve the efficiency of resource use when planning rabies control programs in large urban environments such as S\~ao Paulo. The findings emphasize the need for surveillance and intervention in isolated areas.},

The survey also provided information on insurance status, doctor visits, and ED visits in the previous year. We found that undocumented immigrants in California, and the uninsured among them, had fewer or similar numbers of doctor visits, ED visits, and preventive services use compared to US citizens and other immigrant groups. Allowing undocumented immigrants to purchase insurance in the Marketplaces and ensuring receipt of low-cost preventive services can contribute to lower premiums and reduce resource strains on safety-net providers.},

To better understand the long-term dynamics of urban neighborhood change, we focus our analysis upon the longitudinal relationship of race, socioeconomic status, and life cycle stage to changes in neighborhood population densities. First, we find that the more established neighborhoods of the African-American community have experienced dramatic declines in population since 1950, a pattern that represents a clear change from the earlier part of the twentieth century. Second, population loss is experienced through a variety of mechanisms, including the demolition of dwellings, the increase in housing vacancy, and the decline of household size. Third, much of this population loss should be interpreted within the context of high economic distress, occurring most frequently in older African-American communities. Over time, economic distress appears to be more important than race in and of itself in leading to the loss of neighborhood populations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Travel burden is a key element in conceptualizing geographic access to health care. Prior research has shown that both rural and minority populations bear disproportionate travel burdens. However, many studies are limited to specific types of patient or specific locales. The purpose of our study was to quantify geographic and race-based differences in distance traveled and time spent in travel for medical/dental care using representative national data. METHODS: Data were drawn from 2001 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), a nationally representative, cross-sectional household survey conducted by the US Department of Transportation. Participants recorded all travel on a designated day; the overall response rate was 41\%. Analyses were restricted to households reporting at least one trip for medical and/or dental care; 3,914 trips made by 2,432 households. Dependent variables in the analysis were road miles traveled, minutes spent traveling, and high travel burden, defined as more than 30 miles or 30 minutes per trip. Independent variables of interest were rural residence and race. Characteristics of the individual, the trip, and the community were controlled in multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The average trip for care in the US in 2001 entailed 10.2 road miles (16.4 kilometers) and 22.0 minutes of travel. Rural residents traveled further than urban residents in unadjusted analysis (17.5 versus 8.3 miles; 28.2 versus 13.4 km). Rural trips took 31.4\% longer than urban trips (27.2 versus 20.7 minutes). Distance traveled did not vary by race. African Americans spent more time in travel than whites (29.1 versus 20.6 minutes); other minorities did not differ. In adjusted analyses, rural residence (odds ratio, OR, 2.67, 95\% confidence interval, CI 1.39 5.1.5) was associated with a trip of 30 road miles or more; rural residence (OR, 1.80, CI 1.09 2.99) and African American race/ethnicity (OR 3.04. 95\% CI 2.0 4.62) were associated with a trip lasting 30 minutes or longer.

  abstract = {Background: Human mobility is expected to be a critical factor in the geographic diffusion of infectious diseases, and this assumption led to the implementation of social distancing policies during the early fight against the COVID-19 emergency in the United States. Yet, because of substantial data gaps in the past, what still eludes our understanding are the following questions: 1) How does mobility contribute to the spread of infection within the United States at local, regional, and national scales? 2) How do seasonality and shifts in behavior affect mobility over time? 3) At what geographic level is mobility homogeneous across the United States? Objective: Addressing these questions is critical to developing accurate transmission models, predicting the spatial propagation of disease across scales, and understanding the optimal geographical and temporal scale for the implementation of control policies. Methods: We analyze high-resolution mobility data from mobile app usage from SafeGraph, mapping daily connectivity between US counties to grasp spatial clustering and temporal stability. Integrating this into a spatially explicit transmission model, we replicate SARS-CoV-2's first wave invasion, assessing mobility's spatio-temporal impact on disease predictions. Results: Temporal analysis from 2019 to 2021 reveals that mobility patterns remained relatively stable, aside from a decline in April 2020 due to lockdown measures, reducing daily movements from 45 million to approximately 25 million nationwide. Despite this reduction, intercounty connectivity exhibited seasonal stability and was largely unaffected by these restrictions during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a stable Spearman coefficient between daily intercounty connectivity and gravity networks averaging 0.55. Spatially, we identify 104 geographic clusters of US counties that are highly connected by mobility within the cluster and more sparsely connected to counties outside the cluster. These clusters are stable across time and highly overlap with US state boundaries (mutual information (NMI) equal to 0.82). Furthermore, these regions demonstrate stability over time (NMI = 0.95). Together, these results suggest that intercounty connectivity in the US is relatively static across time and is homogeneous at the sub-state level. We also find that while having access to county-level, daily mobility data best captures the spatial invasion of disease, static mobility data aggregated to the scale of our mobility data-based clusters also performs well in capturing spatial diffusion of infection. Conclusions: Our work demonstrates that intercounty mobility was negligibly affected outside the lockdown period of Spring 2020, explaining the broad spatial distribution of COVID-19 outbreaks in the US during the early phase of the pandemic. Such geographically dispersed outbreaks place a significant strain on national public health resources and necessitate complex metapopulation modeling approaches for predicting disease dynamics and control design. We thus inform the design of such metapopulation models to balance high disease predictability with low data requirements.},

The study area represents diverse population makeups. COVID-19 vaccines were made available by different types of vaccination sites including county mass vaccination sites, medical facilities and pharmacies, and a FEMA community vaccination center in spring 2021. We used the two-step floating catchment area method to measure accessibility and calculated the average accessibility scores of different population groups. We examined the patterns and tested the significance of the differences in accessibility across population groups. The results showed clear spatial heterogeneity in the accessibility to vaccine resources with the existing infrastructure (medical/pharmacy vaccine sites). Accessibility patterns changed with the introduction of county mass sites and the FEMA community site. The county mass vaccination sites in one county greatly increased accessibilities for populations of minority and poverty. The FEMA community site in the other county accomplished the same. Both the local health department and the federal government played an important role in mitigating pre-existing inequalities during the vaccination campaign. Our study shows that social determinants of health need to be addressed and taken into explicit consideration when planning resource distribution during the pandemic.},

  abstract = {Background: The diverse Asian American population has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but due to limited data and other factors, disparities experienced by this population are hidden. Objective: This study aims to describe the Asian American community's experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the Greater San Francisco Bay Area, California, and to better inform a Federally Qualified Health Center's (FQHC) health care services and response to challenges faced by the community. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey between May 20 and June 23, 2020, using a multipronged recruitment approach, including word-of-mouth, FQHC patient appointments, and social media posts. The survey was self-administered online or administered over the phone by FQHC staff in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Vietnamese. Survey question topics included COVID-19 testing and preventative behaviors, economic impacts of COVID-19, experience with perceived mistreatment due to their race/ethnicity, and mental health challenges. Results: Among 1297 Asian American respondents, only 3.1\% (39/1273) had previously been tested for COVID-19, and 46.6\% (392/841) stated that they could not find a place to get tested. In addition, about two-thirds of respondents (477/707) reported feeling stressed, and 22.6\% (160/707) reported feeling depressed. Furthermore, 5.6\% (72/1275) of respondents reported being treated unfairly because of their race/ethnicity. Among respondents who experienced economic impacts from COVID-19, 32.2\% (246/763) had lost their regular jobs and 22.5\% (172/763) had reduced hours or reduced income. Additionally, 70.1\% (890/1269) of respondents shared that they avoid leaving their home to go to public places (eg, grocery stores, church, and school). Conclusions: We found that Asian Americans had lower levels of COVID-19 testing and limited access to testing, a high prevalence of mental health issues and economic impacts, and a high prevalence of risk-avoidant behaviors (eg, not leaving the house) in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings provide preliminary insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Asian American communities served by an FQHC and underscore the longstanding need for culturally and linguistically appropriate approaches to providing mental health, outreach, and education services. These findings led to the establishment of the first Asian multilingual and multicultural COVID-19 testing sites in the local area where the study was conducted, and laid the groundwork for subsequent COVID-19 programs, specifically contact tracing and vaccination programs.},

  abstract = {Cancer surveillance research requires estimates of the prevalence of cancer risk factors and screening for small areas such as counties. Two popular data sources are the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a telephone survey conducted by state agencies, and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), an area probability sample survey conducted through face-to-face interviews. Both data sources have advantages and disadvantages. The BRFSS is a larger survey and almost every county is included in the survey, but it has lower response rates as is typical with telephone surveys and it does not include subjects who live in households with no telephones. On the other hand, the NHIS is a smaller survey, with the majority of counties not included; but it includes both telephone and nontelephone households, and has higher response rates. A preliminary analysis shows that the distributions of cancer screening and risk factors are different for telephone and nontelephone households. Thus, information from the two surveys may be combined to address both nonrespones and noncoverage errors. A hierarchical Bayesian approach that combines information from both surveys is used to construct county-level estimates. The proposed model incorporates potential noncoverage and nonresponse biases in the BRFSS as well as complex sample design features of both surveys. A Markov chain Monte Carlo method is used to simulate draws from the joint posterior distribution of unknown quantities in the model that uses design-based direct estimates and county-level covariates. Yearly prevalence estimates at the county level for 49 states, as well as for the entire state of Alaska and the District of Columbia, are developed for six outcomes using BRFSS and NHIS data from the years 1997---2000. The outcomes include smoking and use of common cancer screening procedures. The NHIS/BRFSS combined county-level estimates are substantially different from those based on the BRFSS alone.

Patients and Methods Using the 2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (comprising hospitalizations between January 1 and December 31, 2011), we identified patients with HCC-related admissions using previously validated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Among these, we also identified those that were procedure-related (associated with liver transplantation, hepatic resection, radiofrequency ablation, or transarterial chemoembolization). Multivariate regression was performed to identify the contribution of race to therapeutic interventions and outcomes. Results A total of 22,933 HCC-related hospitalizations were included, of which 10,285 were procedure related (45\%). Blacks had a smaller proportion (35\%) of procedure-related HCC hospitalizations than did whites (46\%) (odds ratio [OR], 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.49-0.86). Specifically, blacks had lower odds of liver transplantation (OR, 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.26-0.71), hepatic resection (OR, 0.57; 95\% CI, 0.33-0.98), and ablation (OR, 0.46; 95\% CI, 0.29-0.74) (P=.002) than did whites. Overall, 10.9\% of HCC-related admissions resulted in death in blacks as compared with 6.4\% in whites (OR, 1.58; 95\% CI, 1.12-2.24). Conclusion Among patients admitted for HCC-related hospitalizations, blacks were less likely to receive liver transplantation, hepatic resection, and ablation than whites and had higher inhospital mortality. Identifying racial disparities in health care is a necessary first step to appropriately address and eliminate them.}

The most popular approach for estimating the costs of crime focuses on easily measurable factors such as incarceration costs, victims' out-of-pocket expenses, medical costs, and lost earnings. However, the intangible losses incurred by victims of crime have rarely been considered. These losses include pain and suffering, as well as loss of the enjoyment of living. Based on recent developments by Cohen and colleagues, we adopt a more comprehensive method for estimating the dollar value of avoided criminal activity, taking into account these intangible losses. We demonstrate the feasibility of this method by estimating the pre-and posttreatment costs of criminal activity for a sample of 2420 drug abusers. The estimated crime-related costs incurred during the period prior to treatment admission and the period after treatment discharge are significantly higher when calculated using the proposed method compared to methods that only consider tangible costs. Furthermore, a simple benefit-cost comparison of criminal activity outcomes indicates that drug abuse treatment has the potential to return net benefits to society through crime reduction. Although the treatment outcomes are not based on an experimental design, this study presents quantitative evidence that including victims' intangible losses can substantially raise the estimated dollar benefits of avoided criminal activity due to drug abuse interventions.},

  abstract = {Systems level modelling and simulations of biological processes are proving to be invaluable in obtaining a quantitative and dynamic perspective of various aspects of cellular function. In particular, constraint-based analyses of metabolic networks have gained considerable popularity for simulating cellular metabolism, of which flux balance analysis (FBA), is most widely used. Unlike mechanistic simulations that depend on accurate kinetic data, which are scarcely available, FBA is based on the principle of conservation of mass in a network, which utilizes the stoichiometric matrix and a biologically relevant objective function to identify optimal reaction flux distributions. FBA has been used to analyse genome-scale reconstructions of several organisms; it has also been used to analyse the effect of perturbations, such as gene deletions or drug inhibitions in silico. This article reviews the usefulness of FBA as a tool for gaining biological insights, advances in methodology enabling integration of regulatory information and thermodynamic constraints, and finally addresses the challenges that lie ahead. Various use scenarios and biological insights obtained from FBA, and applications in fields such metabolic engineering and drug target identification, are also discussed. Genome-scale constraint-based models have an immense potential for building and testing hypotheses, as well as to guide experimentation.},

  abstract = {Background: In conflict-afflicted areas, pregnant women and newborns often have higher rates of adverse health outcomes. Objective: To describe maternal and child health indicators and interventions between 1998 and 2016 comparing high and low conflict areas in Colombia. Methods: Mixed study of convergent triangulation. In the quantitative component, 16 indicators were calculated using official, secondary data sources. The victimization rate resulting from armed conflict was calculated by municipality and grouped into quintiles. In the qualitative component, a comparative case study was carried out in two municipalities of Antioquia: one with high rates of armed conflict and another with low rates. A total of 41 interviews and 8 focus groups were held with local and national government officials, health professionals, community informants, UN agencies and NGOs. Results: All of the indicators show improvement, however, four show statistically significant differences between municipalities with high victimization rates versus low ones. The maternal mortality ratio was higher in the municipalities with greater victimization in the periods 1998--2004, 2005--2011 and 2012--2016. The percentage of cesarean births and women who received four or more antenatal visits was lower among women who experienced the highest levels of victimization for the period 1998--2000, while the fertility rate for women between 15 and 19 years was higher in these municipalities between 2012 and 2016. In the context of the armed conflict in Colombia, maternal and child health was affected by the limited availability of interventions given the lack of human resources in health, supplies, geographical access difficulties and insecurity. The national government was the one that mostly provided the programs, with difficulties in continuity and quality. UN Agencies and NGOs accessed more easily remote and intense armed conflict areas. Few specific health interventions were identified in the postconflict context. Conclusions: In Colombia, maternal and child health indicators have improved since the conflict, however a pattern of inequality is observed in the municipalities most affected by the armed conflict.},

The authors examined whether Black and Latina community members' perceptions of stigmatization and personal feelings about their group relate to immune and endocrine markers associated with health risk, including the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), which coordinates the immune response to infection, the anabolic hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), which promotes cellular resilience, and the catabolic hormone cortisol, which releases metabolic stores in response to threat. Greater perceived stigmatization was associated with higher basal IL-6, whereas greater ingroup pride was related to elevated basal DHEA. These associations remained with adjustment for general perceived stress, experience with discrimination, age, and income. No significant perceived stigmatization or ingroup pride effects emerged for basal cortisol. These findings provide new evidence that perceived stigmatization and ingroup pride are linked to indicators of disease and resilience, respectively, highlighting mechanisms through which racial and ethnic stigmatization may contribute to health disparities.},

  abstract = {The literature on the effectiveness of peacekeeping has been focused almost exclusively on conflict mitigation. This article expands the scope of this literature by developing a theory that explains how the presence of peacekeeping forces improves population health during periods of intrastate conflict. The argument is put forth that because civil conflict violence clusters geographically it undermines the herd immunity critical-mass threshold. This, in turn, leads to increased infection rates and a tragic surge in preventable deaths. Peacekeepers, because they target conflict `hot spots' locally, put an end to this cycle and assist in the restoration herd immunity. Using a unique measure of peacekeeping that accounts for the area of the conflict zone, the empirical models uncover a positive relationship between peacekeeping forces and immunization rates, as vaccination rates increase when peacekeepers are deployed into violent conflicts. These findings suggest that peacekeeping missions have the potential to reduce the public health costs imposed by internal conflicts.},

We have performed a systematic analysis of the HXT1-7 and GAL2 genes and their function in hexose transport. Glucose uptake was below the detection level in the hxt1-7 null strain growing on maltose. Determination of the kinetic parameters of individual hexose transporter-related proteins (Hxtp) expressed in the hxt null background revealed Hxt1p and Hxt3p as low-affinity transporters (Km(glucose) = 50-100 mM), Hxt2p and Hxt4p as moderately low in affinity (Km(glucose) about 10 mM), and Hxt6p, Hxt7p as well as Gal2p as high-affinity transporters (Km(glucosse) = 1-2 mM). However, Hxt2p kinetics in cells grown on low glucose concentrations showed a high-affinity (Km = 1.5 mM) and a low-affinity component (Km = 60 mM). Furthermore, we investigated the involvement of glucose transport in glucose signalling. Glucose repression of MAL2, SUC2 and GAL1 was not dependent on a specific transporter but, instead, the strength of the repression signal was dependent on the level of expression, the properties of the individual transporters and the kind of sugar transported. The strength of the glucose repression signal correlated with the glucose consumption rates in the different strains, indicating that glucose transport limits the provision of a triggering signal rather then being directly involved in the triggering mechanism.},

Differences in past week depressive symptoms and anxious symptoms were examined cross-sectionally by gender identity. Gender minority and nongender minority respondents were compared using age-adjusted logistic regression models. Results In gender minorities, the prevalence of depressive and anxious symptoms meeting clinical cutoffs was 52\% and 38\%, respectively, compared with nongender minorities (27\% and 30\% in females and 25\% and 14\% in males; p {$<$} .01). Conclusions Gender identity is an understudied social determinant of mental health.

The viral kinase pUL97, a functional ortholog of cellular cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), is critical for HCMV replication and a target for antiviral drug development. Upon kinase inhibition, drug-resistant strains emerge with mutations in UL27, an HCMV gene of unknown function. Using a proteomics approach, we discovered that pUL27 is necessary and sufficient to degrade Tip60, a host acetyltransferase and interacting partner of HIV Tat. Consistent with this, the expression of Tat restored antiviral inhibition of an otherwise resistant HCMV strain. The functional consequence of Tip60 degradation was the induction of the CDK inhibitor p21(Waf1/Cip1) and cell-cycle arrest, representing changes necessary for the antiviral effects of pUL97 inhibition. Consequently, either increasing p21(Waf1/Cip1) expression or decreasing Tip60 levels improved the antiviral activity of the HCMV kinase inhibitor maribavir.},

OBJECTIVES: We examined estimated lifetime cancer risk from air toxics by racial composition, segregation, and deprivation in census tracts in Metropolitan Charleston. METHODS: Segregation indices were used to measure the distribution of groups of people from different races within neighborhoods. The Townsend Index was used to measure economic deprivation in the study area. Poisson multivariate regressions were applied to assess the association of lifetime cancer risk with segregation indices and Townsend Index along with several sociodemographic measures. RESULTS: Lifetime cancer risk from all pollution sources was 28 persons/million for half of the census tracts in Metropolitan Charleston. Isolation Index and Townsend Index both showed significant correlation with lifetime cancer risk from different sources. This significance still holds after adjusting for other sociodemographic measures in a Poisson regression, and these two indices have stronger effect on lifetime cancer risk compared to the effects of sociodemographic measures. CONCLUSIONS: We found that material deprivation, measured by the Townsend Index and segregation measured by the Isolation index, introduced high impact on lifetime cancer risk by air toxics at the census tract level.},

However, it is not clear whether differences in tumor characteristics or liver dysfunction among racial or ethnic groups affect characterization of causes for this disparity. We aimed to characterize racial and ethnic differences in HCC presentation, treatment, and survival. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with HCC from January 2008 through July 2017 at 2 large health systems in the United States. We used multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models to identify factors associated with receipt of curative therapy and overall survival. Results: Among 1117 patients with HCC (35.9\% white, 34.3\% black, 29.7\% Hispanic), 463 (41.5\%) were diagnosed with early stage HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 0/A) and 322 (28.8\%) underwent curative treatment. Hispanic (odds ratio [OR], 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.55--1.00) and black patients (OR, 0.74; 95\% CI, 0.56--0.98) were less likely to be diagnosed with early stage HCC than white patients. Among patients with early stage HCC, Hispanics were less likely to undergo curative treatment than whites (OR, 0.58; 95\% CI, 0.36--0.91). Black patients with early stage HCC were also less likely to undergo curative treatment than white patients, but this difference was not statistically significant (OR, 0.66; 95\% CI, 0.43--1.03). Black and Hispanic patients had shorter median survival times than white patients (10.6 and 14.4 mo vs 16.3 mo). After adjusting for type of medical insurance, Child--Pugh class, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage, and receipt of HCC treatment, black patients had significantly higher mortality (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95\% CI, 1.10--1.14) and Hispanic patients had lower mortality (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.74--0.94) than white patients. Conclusions: In a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with HCC, we found racial/ethnic differences in outcomes of HCC to be associated with differences in detection of tumors at early stages and receipt of curative treatment. These factors are intervention targets for improving patient outcomes and reducing disparities.},

Median distance from clinic was 3.6 (IQR 2.1--5.6) miles versus 3.9 (IQR 2.7--6.1) miles among those retained versus not retained in care, p\,=\,0.06. Median travel time by car was 15.9 (IQR 9.6--22.9) versus 17.1 (IQR 12.0--24.6) minutes for those retained versus not retained, p\,=\,0.04. Violent crime rate along travel route was not associated with retention. There was no significant association between travel time or distance and viral suppression.},

  abstract = {The number of persons with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the United States is affected by diminishing numbers of young persons who are susceptible because of universal infant vaccination since 1991, offset by numbers of HBV-infected persons migrating to the United States from endemic countries. The prevalence of HBV infection was determined by serological testing and analysis among noninstitutionalized persons age 6 years and older for: antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), indicative of previous HBV infection; hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), indicative of chronic (current) infection; and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), indicative of immunity from vaccination. These prevalence estimates were analyzed in three periods of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES): 1988-1994 (21,260 persons); 1999-2008 (29,828); and 2007-2012 (22,358). In 2011-2012, for the first time, non-Hispanic Asians were oversampled in NHANES. For the most recent period (2007-2012), 3.9\% had anti-HBc, indicating approximately 10.8 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 9.4-12.2) million noninstitutionalized U.S. residents having ever been infected with HBV. The overall prevalence of chronic HBV infection has remained constant since 1999: 0.3\% (95\% CI: 0.2-0.4), and since 1999, prevalence of chronic HBV infection among non-Hispanic blacks has been 2- to 3-fold greater than the general population. An estimated 3.1\% (1.8\%-5.2\%) of non-Hispanic Asians were chronically infected with HBV during 2011-2012, which reflects a 10-fold greater prevalence than the general population. Adjusted prevalence of vaccine-induced immunity increased 16\% since 1999, and the number of persons (mainly young) with serological evidence of vaccine protection from HBV infection rose from 57.8 (95\% CI: 55.4-60.1) million to 68.5 (95\% CI: 65.4-71.2) million.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Despite increasing immune protection in young persons vaccinated in infancy, an analysis of chronic hepatitis B prevalence in racial and ethnic populations indicates that during 2011-2012, there were 847,000 HBV infections (which included {$\sim$}400,000 non-Hispanic Asians) in the noninstitutionalized U.S.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nPOPULATION: (Hepatology 2015).},

Objectives: (1) To determine the relationship between nativity/immigration status and self-reported quality of care and preventive care. (2) To assess the impact of a usual source of health care on receipt of preventive care among Latinos. Design: Using cross-sectional data from the 2007 Pew Hispanic Center/Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Hispanic Healthcare Survey, a nationally representative telephone survey of 4,013 Latino adults, we compared US-born Latinos with foreign-born Latino citizens, foreign-born Latino permanent residents and undocumented Latinos. We estimated odds ratios using separate multivariate ordered logistic models for five outcomes: blood pressure checked in the past 2 years, cholesterol checked in the past 5 years, perceived quality of medical care in the past year, perceived receipt of no health/health-care information from a doctor in the past year, and language concordance. Results: Undocumented Latinos had the lowest percentages of insurance coverage (37\% vs 77\% US-born, P{$<$}0.001), usual source of care (58\% vs 79\% US-born, P{$<$}0.001), blood pressure checked (67\% vs 87\% US-born, P{$<$}0.001), cholesterol checked (56\% vs 83\% US-born, P{$<$}0.001), and reported excellent/good care in the past year (76\% vs 80\% US-born, P{$<$}0.05). Undocumented Latinos also reported the highest percentage receiving no health/health-care information from their doctor (40\% vs 20\% US-born, P{$<$}0.001) in the past year. Adjusted results showed that undocumented status was associated with lower likelihood of blood pressure checked in the previous 2 years (OR=0.60; 95\% CI, 0.43-0.84), cholesterol checked in the past 5 years (OR=0.62; 95\% CI, 0.39-0.99), and perceived receipt of excellent/good care in the past year (OR=0.56; 95\% CI, 0.39-0.77). Having a usual source of care increased the likelihood of a blood pressure check in the past 2 years and a cholesterol check in the past 5 years. Conclusion: In this national sample, undocumented Latinos were less likely to report receiving blood pressure and cholesterol level checks, less likely to report having received excellent/good quality of care, and more likely to receive no health/health-care information from doctors, even after adjusting for potential confounders. Our study shows that differences in nativity/immigration status should be taken into consideration when we discuss perceived quality of care among Latinos. \copyright{} 2009 Society of General Internal Medicine.},

Enterococcal bacteremia is associated with an imposing 20\%--35\% 30-day mortality rate, likely at least in some part due to the advanced age, multiple comorbid conditions, and/or underlying immunocompromised state typical among patients affected by enterococcal bacteremia [2--4]. Beyond the intrinsic antimicrobial resistance present in Enterococcus species, increasing rates of acquired resistance to multiple antimicrobials have further limited potential therapeutic options. Persistent enterococcal bacteremia despite seemingly appropriate antimicrobial treatment (based on in vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities) is a relatively frequent occurrence in clinical practice, at times due to an underlying inadequately addressed nidus of infection though frequently occurring without any such identified uncontrolled source. Current best practices for management of persistent enterococcal bacteremia are understudied and largely undefined.},

  abstract = {Community health centers are the nation's largest source of comprehensive primary care for medically underserved communities and populations. Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), increased patient revenues due to the expansion of Medicaid and private health insurance, along with substantially increased direct federal investment in the program, have led to growth in the number of health centers and their capacity to provide services. This brief draws on 2015 federal data on health centers and our 2016 Survey of Health Centers' Experiences and Activities under the Affordable Care Act to provide a snapshot of health centers and their patients, analyze recent changes, and compare the experience of health centers in Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states. This information is germane to the impending debate on the ACA and the potential impact of changes on coverage and access to care for low-income Americans and financing for safety-net providers. Key findings include:  Health centers are a core source of primary care in the U.S., particularly for Medicaid beneficiaries and uninsured people. In 2015, 1,375 health centers provided care to 24.3 million patients, including 1 in 12 U.S. residents and nearly 1 in 6 Medicaid enrollees. Almost three-quarters of all health center patients had income below the poverty level.  Health center patients are increasingly insured, primarily due to the ACA Medicaid expansion. In 2015, 76\% of health center patients were insured (49\% through Medicaid), up from 65\% in 2013, the year before the ACA coverage expansions took effect. State Medicaid expansion decisions made a large difference in coverage. Over half of health center patients in expansion states had Medicaid, compared to one-third in non-expansion states. About 1 in 5 health center patients in Medicaid expansion states remained uninsured, compared to 1 in 3 in non-expansion states.  The Medicaid expansion strengthened health center finances and capacity.

The population of these three areas, with regard to age, race, and country of birth, was estimated from a special tabulation of the 1980 US census. Rates of primary liver cancer were higher for men born in Asia than Asian men born in the US, who, in turn, had higher rates than did US Whites (respective annual rates per 100,000: Chinese, 26.5 and 9.8; Japanese, 16.5 and 6.6; Filipinos, 11.4 and 6.5; US Whites, 3.4). Among Asian American women, the trends were not as consistent (respective annual rates per 100,000: Chinese, 2.2 and 3.7; Japanese, 1.9 and 1.4; Filipino, 2.6 and 0; US Whites, 1.1). In general, liver cancer incidence among Asian Americans was lower than among residents of Asia. These findings are compatible with substantial variation among Asians in the prevalence of one or more etiologic factors for liver cancer, such as hepatitis-B infection and aflatoxin consumption, in relation to residence and place of birth.}

LLMs are proving capable of providing interfaces for understanding and synthesizing large databases of diverse media. This presents an exciting opportunity to supercharge the translation of scientific evidence into policy and action, thereby improving livelihoods around the world. However, these models also pose challenges related to access, trust-worthiness, and accountability. The BUMPER framework is built atop a scientific knowledge base (e.g., documentation, code, survey data) by the same scientists (e.g., individual contributor, lab, consortium). We focus on a solution that builds trustworthiness through transparency, scope-limiting, explicit-checks, and uncertainty measures. LLMs are rapidly being adopted and consequences are poorly understood. The framework addresses open questions regarding the reliability of LLMs and their use in high-stakes applications. We provide a worked example in health policy for a model designed to inform measles control programs. We argue that this framework can facilitate accessibility of and confidence in scientific evidence for policymakers, drive a focus on policy-relevance and translatability for researchers, and ultimately increase and accelerate the impact of scientific knowledge used for policy decisions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: International migrants experience increased mortality from hepatocellular carcinoma compared to host populations, largely due to undetected chronic hepatitis B infection (HBV). We conducted a systematic review of the seroprevalence of chronic HBV and prior immunity in migrants arriving in low HBV prevalence countries to identify those at highest risk in order to guide disease prevention and control strategies.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: Medline, Medline In-Process, EMBASE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched. Studies that reported HBV surface antigen or surface antibodies in migrants were included. The seroprevalence of chronic HBV and prior immunity were pooled by region of origin and immigrant class, using a random-effects model. A random-effects logistic regression was performed to explore heterogeneity. The number of chronically infected migrants in each immigrant-receiving country was estimated using the pooled HBV seroprevalences and country-specific census data. A total of 110 studies, representing 209,822 immigrants and refugees were included. The overall pooled seroprevalence of infection was 7.2\% (95\% CI: 6.3\%-8.2\%) and the seroprevalence of prior immunity was 39.7\% (95\% CI: 35.7\%-43.9\%). HBV seroprevalence differed significantly by region of origin. Migrants from East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa were at highest risk and migrants from Eastern Europe were at an intermediate risk of infection. Region of origin, refugee status and decade of study were independently associated with infection in the adjusted random-effects logistic model. Almost 3.5 million migrants (95\% CI: 2.8-4.5 million) are estimated to be chronically infected with HBV.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence of chronic HBV infection is high in migrants from most world regions, particularly among those from East Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern Europe, and more than 50\% were found to be susceptible to HBV. Targeted screening and vaccination of international migrants can become an important component of HBV disease control efforts in immigrant-receiving countries.},

CHCs could potentially reduce uninsured emergency department (ED) visits in rural communities. PURPOSE: We compared uninsured ED visit rates between rural counties in Georgia that have a CHC clinic site and counties without a CHC presence. METHODS: We analyzed data from 100\% of ED visits occurring in 117 rural (non-metropolitan statistical area [MSA]) counties in Georgia from 2003 to 2005. The counties were classified as having a CHC presence if a federally funded (Section 330) CHC had a primary care delivery site in that county throughout the study period. The main outcome measure was uninsured ED visit rates among the uninsured (all-cause ED visits and visits for ambulatory care sensitive conditions). Poisson regression models were used to examine the relationship between ED rates and the presence of a CHC. To ensure that the effects were unique to the uninsured population, we ran similar analyses on insured ED visits. FINDINGS: Counties without a CHC primary care clinic site had 33\% higher rates of uninsured all-cause ED visits per 10,000 uninsured population compared with non-CHC counties (rate ratio [RR] 1.33, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.59). Higher ED visit rates remained significant (RR 1.21, 95\% CI 1.02-1.42) after adjustment for percentage of population below poverty level, percentage of black population, and number of hospitals. Uninsured ED visit rates were also higher for various categories of diagnoses, but remained statistically significant on multivariate analysis only for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (adjusted RR = 1.22, 95\% CI 1.01-1.47). No such relationship was found for ED visit rates of insured patients (RR 1.06, 95\% CI 0.92-1.22). CONCLUSIONS: The absence of a CHC is associated with a substantial excess in uninsured ED visits in rural counties, an excess not seen for ED visit rates among the insured.},

Coffee consumption was associated with improved serum gamma glutamyltransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase values in a dose dependent manner in individuals at risk for liver disease. In chronic liver disease patients who consume coffee, a decreased risk of progression to cirrhosis, a lowered mortality rate in cirrhosis patients, and a lowered rate of HCC development were observed. In chronic hepatitis C patients, coffee was associated with improved virologic responses to antiviral therapy. Moreover, coffee consumption was inversely related to the severity of steatohepatitis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Therefore, in patients with chronic liver disease, daily coffee consumption should be encouraged.},

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a condition with similar histology in the absence of a history of alcohol intake. Although the distinction is essentially based on presence or absence of a history of significant alcohol intake, certain histologic features favour one or the other diagnosis. This review aims at describing the histologic spectrum of alcoholic liver disease and at highlighting the histologic differences between ALD and NASH.},

  abstract = {A major link between inflammation and cancer is provided by NF-kappaB transcription factors. Ikkbeta(Deltahep) mice, which specifically lack IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta), an activator of NF-kappaB, in hepatocytes, are unable to activate NF-kappaB in response to proinflammatory stimuli, such as TNF-alpha. Surprisingly, Ikkbeta(Deltahep) mice are hypersusceptible to diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Because defective NF-kappaB activation promotes sustained c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation in cells exposed to TNF-alpha, whose expression is induced by DEN, and JNK activity is required for normal hepatocyte proliferation, we examined whether increased susceptibility to DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in Ikkbeta(Deltahep) mice requires JNK activation. Hepatocytes express both JNK1 and JNK2, but previous studies indicate that JNK1 is more important for hepatocyte proliferation. We therefore investigated this hypothesis using mice homozygous for a JNK1 deficiency either in wild-type or Ikkbeta(Deltahep) backgrounds. In both cases, mice lacking JNK1 were much less susceptible to DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. This impaired tumorigenesis correlated with decreased expression of cyclin D and vascular endothelial growth factor, diminished cell proliferation, and reduced tumor neovascularization. Whereas hepatocyte-specific deletion of IKKbeta augmented DEN-induced hepatocyte death and cytokine-driven compensatory proliferation, disruption of JNK1 abrogated this response. In addition to underscoring the importance of JNK1-mediated hepatocyte death and compensatory proliferation, these results strongly suggest that the control of tissue renewal through the IKK and JNK pathways plays a key role in liver carcinogenesis.},

Approximately one in four children may experience life-long consequences, including sensorineural hearing loss and neurodisability. Knowledge regarding prevention, diagnosis, and treatment increased in the recent years, but some challenges remain. In this review, we tried to summarize the current knowledge on both the obstetrical and pediatric areas, while also highlighting controversial aspects and future perspectives. There is a need to enhance awareness among the general population and pregnant women through specific information programs. Further research is needed to better define the classification of individuals at birth and to have a deeper understanding of the long-term outcomes for so defined children. Finally, the availability of valaciclovir medication throughout pregnancy, where appropriate, has prompted the assessment of a universal serological antenatal screening. It is recommended to establish a dedicated unit for better evaluation and management of both mothers and children.},

We analyze recent and long-term trends of US liver cancer incidence by race/ethnicity and sex to best understand where to focus preventive efforts. Methods: Liver cancer incidence rates from 1992 to 2016 were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry. Delay-adjusted age-standardized incidence trends by race/ethnicity and sex were analyzed using joinpoint regression. Age-specific incidence was analyzed using age-period-cohort models. Hepatitis C seroprevalence by cohort was calculated using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. Results: Liver cancer incidence has peaked in males and Asian or Pacific Islanders. Hispanic males, a high-incidence population, are experiencing a decrease in incidence, although not yet statistically significant. In contrast, incidence continues to increase in females, although at lower rates than in the 1990s, and American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs). Liver cancer incidence continues to be higher in males. Non-Hispanic Whites have the lowest incidence among racial/ethnic groups. Trends largely reflect differences in incidence by birth-cohort, which increased considerably, particularly in males, for those born around the 1950s, and continues to increase in females and AI/ANs. The patterns in males are likely driven by cohort variations in Hepatitis C infection. Conclusions: Liver cancer incidence appears to have peaked among males. However, important differences in liver cancer trends by race/ethnicity and sex remain, highlighting the need for monitoring trends across different groups. Preventive interventions should focus on existing liver cancer disparities, targeting AI/ANs, females, and high-incidence groups.},

However, few studies have examined the spectrum of infections in FN in patients with SAA, especially in children. Therefore, the current study was planned to study the clinicomicrobiologic profile of FN episodes in these children.           Materials and Methods:~           Data of 38 episodes of FN that occurred in 31 children with SAA from November 2015 to April 2017 were collected prospectively and analyzed.           Results:~           FN episodes occurred more frequently (54.8\%) in patients on immunosuppressive therapy. Clinically documented infections accounted for 21 (55.26\%) episodes, microbiologically documented infections for 15 (39.47\%), bacteremia for 13 (34.21\%), and invasive fungal diseases for 6 (15.78\%) episodes. Among clinically documented infections, the lower respiratory tract was the commonest site in 23.68\% episodes, followed by skin and soft tissue infections. No focus of infection could be identified in 12 (31.57\%) episodes. Gram-negative bacteria (71.42\%) were the predominant isolates (commonest Klebsiella pneumoniae) over Gram-positive bacteria (commonest coagulase-negative Staphylococcus). High prevalence of aminoglycoside, piperacillin-tazobactam, and carbapenem resistance was noted among Gram-negative organisms. Gram-positive organisms showed excellent sensitivity to vancomycin, linezolid, and clindamycin. The overall mortality rate was 42\%.           Conclusions:~           Empirical antimicrobial therapy should include adequate coverage for Gram-negative pathogens. The antimicrobial regimen should be modified according to the results of the culture and sensitivity testing.},

STUDY DESIGN:These were open-label extension studies in which patients who had previously completed a 12-week, double-blind study received oxycodone PR/naloxone PR for up to 52 weeks. The analgesia study assessed pain using the modified Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF). The bowel function study assessed improvements in constipation using the Bowel Function Index (BFI). RESULTS:At open-label baseline in the analgesia study (n = 379), mean score [+/- standard deviation (SD)] for the BPI-SF item 'average pain over the last 24 h' was 3.9 +/- 1.52, and this remained low at 6 months (3.7 +/- 1.59) and 12 months (3.8 +/- 1.72). Mean scores for BPI-SF item 'sleep interference', and the BPI-SF 'pain' and 'interference with activities' subscales also remained low throughout the 52-week study. In the bowel function study (n = 258), mean BFI score (+/- SD) decreased from 35.6 +/- 27.74 at the start of the extension study to 20.6 +/- 24.01 after 12 months of treatment with oxycodone PR/naloxone PR. Pain scores also remained low and stable during this study. Adverse events in both extension phases were consistent with those associated with opioid therapy; no additional safety concerns were observed. CONCLUSION:Results from these two open-label extension studies demonstrate the long-term efficacy and tolerability of fixed combination oxycodone PR/naloxone PR in the treatment of chronic pain. Patients experienced clinically relevant improvements in OIBD while receiving effective analgesic therapy.},

Cirrhosis is characterized by a decrease in hepatocyte proliferation, indicating an exhaustion of the regenerative capacity of the liver, and results in an increase in fibrous tissue and a destruction of liver cells, which may ultimately lead to the development of cancerous nodules. Half of all cases of HCC are associated with hepatitis B virus infection, with a further 25\% associated with hepatitis C virus. Other risk factors for developing HCC include alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, intake of aflatoxin-contaminated food, diabetes, and obesity. There are multiple factors involved in the etiology of HCC, all of which have a direct impact on patient characteristics and disease course, and although a causative agent can often be identified, HCC remains an extremely complex condition associated with a poor prognosis. Additionally, the geographic variation in etiology means that information from different countries is needed in order to optimize surveillance methods and develop effective chemoprevention strategies. Unfortunately, there are still many gaps in our current understanding, and further research efforts are needed to fully elucidate the diverse mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of HCC and offer optimal prevention strategies for those at risk.},

We explored the effects of race and socioeconomic factors on transplantation for HCC while controlling for stage, resection status, and transplant candidacy. Patients and methods: All HCC patients, 2003--2013, were retrospectively analyzed using multivariate analysis to explore differences in transplantation rates among cohorts. Results: Of 3078 HCC patients, 754 (24\%) were considered transplant eligible. Odds of transplantation were significantly higher for those with commercial insurance (OR = 1.99, 95\% CI [1.42, 2.79]) and lower for black patients (OR = 0.55, 95\% CI [0.33, 0.91]). Asians were more likely to be resected than white patients with similarly staged tumors and transplant criteria (p {$<$} 0.001). Patients not listed for transplantation for non-medical reasons were more likely to be government-insured (p = 0.02) and not white (p = 0.05). No step along the transplantation pathway was identified as the dominant hurdle. Discussion: Patients who are black or government-insured are significantly less likely to undergo transplantation for HCC despite controlling for tumor stage, resection status, and transplant eligibility. Asian patients have higher rates of hepatic resection, but also appear to have lower transplantation rates beyond this effect.}

We conducted a hospital-based cohort study among patients with chronic HCV infection to assess an association between baseline coffee consumption and subsequent ALT levels for 12 months.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1 August 2005 to 31 July 2006, total 376 HCV-RNA positive patients were recruited. A baseline questionnaire elicited information on the frequency of coffee consumption and other caffeine-containing beverages. ALT level as a study outcome was followed through the patients' medical records during 12 months. The association between baseline beverage consumption and subsequent ALT levels was evaluated separately among patients with baseline ALT levels within normal range ({$\leq$}45 IU/L) and among those with higher ALT levels ({$>$}45 IU/L).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Among 229 patients with baseline ALT levels within normal range, 186 (81\%) retained normal ALT levels at 12 months after recruitment. Daily drinkers of filtered coffee were three times more likely to preserve a normal ALT level than non-drinkers (OR=2.74; P=0.037). However, decaffeinated coffee drinkers had a somewhat inverse effect for sustained normal ALT levels, with marginal significance (OR=0.26; P=0.076). In addition, among 147 patients with higher baseline ALT levels, 39 patients (27\%) had ALT reductions of {$\geq$}20 IU/L at 12 months after recruitment. Daily drinkers of filtered coffee had a significantly increased OR for ALT reduction (OR=3.79; P=0.034). However, in decaffeinated coffee drinkers, OR could not be calculated because no patients had ALT reduction.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Among patients with chronic HCV infection, daily consumption of filtered coffee may have a beneficial effect on the stabilization of ALT levels.},

METHODS In our retrospective survey, the medical charts of all children who were younger than 17 years and sought medical attention after a dog bite between 1994 and 2003 were reviewed. To obtain the total number of each dog breed in the administrative district, we analyzed 5873 files from the community dog registers. For establishment of a risk index, the representation of a dog breed among the total canine population was divided by the frequency of dog bites from this breed. RESULTS A total of 341 children (mean age: 5.9 years) were identified. The annual incidence of dog bites was 0.5 per 1000 children between 0 and 16 years of age. Incidence was highest in 1-year-old patients and decreased with increasing age. The relative risk for a dog attack by a German shepherd or a Doberman was approximately 5 times higher than that of a Labrador/retriever or cross-breed. The vast majority (82\%) of the dogs were familiar to the children. Most (322; 94\%) of the children had injuries to 1 body region; in the remaining 19 (6\%) children, up to 3 body regions were injured. Of 357 injuries, the face, head, and neck region was the leading site affected (50\%). Inpatient treatment was required in 93 (27\%) patients. CONCLUSIONS Dog bites in children are frequent and influenced by the breed-related behavior of dogs, dog owners, children, and parents. Therefore, prevention strategies should focus on public education and training of dogs and their owners. Children who are younger than 10 years represent the high-risk group for dog attacks.},

  abstract = {Thirty years ago, Congress enacted the landmark Fair Housing Act of 1968, which out-lawed for the first time private as well as public discrimination in housing. Twenty years later, Congress passed the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, a law that significantly expanded the scope of the original legislation and strengthened its enforcement mecha-nisms. Like most important pieces of Federal legislation, the Fair Housing Act and the 1988 Amendments Act embody a series of careful compromises crafted by members of Congress. In this article, we examine the first decade of experience under the 1988 Amendments. We briefly describe the unusual enforcement process created by the Amendments, that permits either party to choose which branch of government will adjudicate their dispute. Using contemporaneous legislative history, we also explain why Congress devised such an enforcement mechanism and how members expected it would operate in practice. In the remainder of the article, we use administrative data obtained from the Federal Govern-ment as part of an ongoing effort to evaluate fair housing enforcement to describe the first 10 years under the Amendment. Particular attention will be paid to the question of whether the enforcement mechanisms contained in the 1988 Amendments Act have ful-filled the expectations of its sponsors.},

Important algebraic concepts used in pathway analysis, such as null space and convex cone, are explained. It is demonstrated how these concepts can be translated into meaningful metabolic concepts. For example, it is shown that the simplest vectors spanning the region of all admissible fluxes in stationary states, for which the term elementary flux modes was coined, correspond to fundamental pathways in the system. The concepts are illustrated with the help of a reaction scheme representing the glyoxylate cycle and adjacent reactions of aspartate and glutamate synthesis. The interrelations between pathway analysis and metabolic control theory are outlined. Promising applications for genome annotation and for biotechnological purposes are discussed. Armed with a better understanding of the architecture of cellular metabolism and the enormous amount of genomic data available today, biochemists and biotechnologists will be able to draw the entire metabolic map of a cell and redesign it by rational and directed metabolic engineering.},

DESIGN--An ecological study in which measles incidence was compared with immunization coverage among census tracts. The independent effects of race and population density were controlled for. SETTING--A recent measles outbreak in Milwaukee, Wis. Immunization coverage data were estimated from a retrospective, school-based survey of Milwaukee grade school students. PATIENTS--One thousand eleven persons (less than or equal to 17 years) who had confirmed measles from September 1989 through June 1990. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Confirmed measles cases grouped by census tract, corresponding census tract preoutbreak immunization coverage, racial breakdown, and population density. RESULTS--Census tracts stratified into four levels, with mean immunization rates of 50.4\%, 60.2\%, 69.9\%, and 81.0\%, had respective median attack rates of 11.6, 5.0, 1.7, and 0.0 cases per 1000 persons (P less than .01). The association between immunization coverage and measles attack rate remained significant even after controlling for race and population density. CONCLUSIONS--Modest improvements in low levels of immunization coverage among 2-year-olds confer substantial protection against measles outbreaks. Coverage of 80\% or less may be sufficient to prevent sustained measles outbreaks in an urban community.},

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the extent to which non-response impacts the representativeness of the 2000 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) sample compared to the 2000 Decennial Census.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: The 2000 BRFSS had a median response rate of 48\%, while the 2000 Decennial Census had a response rate of 67\%. Representativeness of the BRFSS sample was evaluated on gender, race, ethnicity, age, household income and marital status. Prevalence of each factor in the BRFSS was compared to the prevalence found in the US Census on both the state and county levels. Prevalence differences between the BRFSS and Census were calculated and their association with response rates was evaluated using robust OLS regression and polytomous logistic regression. The relationship between prevalence differences and other survey design elements, such as data collection procedure and sampling fraction, was also explored.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: The BRFSS prevalence estimates diverged from the Census estimates on several sociodemographic factors even after adjustment for non-response/non-coverage. This was found on both the state and county levels; however, smaller absolute differences between the BRFSS and Census prevalence estimates were found for factors included in the non-response/non-coverage adjustment weight. Lower response rates ({$<$}40\%) were associated with the under-representation of racial/ethnic minorities, women and younger individuals in the BRFSS survey.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Future research should examine alternative approaches to increase response rate (eg, mixed mode) and to adjust for non-response (eg, multiple imputation).},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the extent to which geographic disparities exist in mammography use across counties in the contiguous United States.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: We estimated county-level prevalence of recent mammography (past 2 years) for women aged 40 to 79 years by using synthetic regression, a small-area estimation method. The 2000 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 2000 Census, Area Resource File, and Food and Drug Administration mammography facility data were merged by BRFSS respondents' county of residence. We conducted separate analyses to produce county-level prevalence estimates for each race and age group.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Mammography use varied geographically, and the magnitude of geographic disparities differed by race and age. Nonwhite women showed the lowest prevalence of mammography and widest range in county-level estimates. Women aged 40 to 49 had generally lower prevalence than other age groups, while women aged 65 to 79 showed the greatest variation in county-level mammography estimates.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Small-area estimation using BRFSS data is advantageous for surveillance of mammography use at the county level. This method allows documentation of geographic disparities and improves our understanding of the spatial distribution of mammography prevalence. Future interventions should consider this county-level geographic variation, targeting women in the neediest counties.},

They propose a conceptual framework for environmental health promotion that considers dynamic social processes through which social and environmental inequalities--and associated health disparities--are produced, reproduced, and potentially transformed. Using empirical evidence from the published literature, as well as their own practical experiences in conducting community-based participatory research in Detroit and Harlem, the authors examine health promotion interventions at various levels (community-wide, regional, and national) that aim to improve population health by addressing various aspects of social processes and/or physical environments. Finally, they recommend moving beyond environmental remediation strategies toward environmental health promotion efforts that are sustainable and explicitly designed to reduce social, environmental, and health inequalities.},

At-risk youth were recruited through street outreach for individual interviews and focus group sessions. Types of experiential violence identified included (1) street, (2) family/interpersonal, (3) school, (4) indirect exposure (e.g., neighborhood crime), and (5) prejudice/discrimination. Reactions ranged from motivating positive effects (resilience, determination to escape) to negative effects (fear, paranoia, and aggression). For some, experiences with violence motivated them to pursue educational achievement and positive lifestyles. Causes of violence were described by participants as existing at a number of different levels (societal, neighborhood, interpersonal, and individual), reflecting a social-ecological perspective. Our findings highlight a need for violence prevention efforts that focus on a broad definition of violence, as well as on the poly-victimization of children and youth. At the same time, our findings highlight the challenges of conducting effective community-based prevention programs in urban settings characterized by spatial inequalities and social exclusion of community residents.},

  abstract = {An important goal of whole-cell computational modeling is to integrate detailed biochemical information with biological intuition to produce testable predictions. Based on the premise that prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli have maximized their growth performance along evolution, flux balance analysis (FBA) predicts metabolic flux distributions at steady state by using linear programming. Corroborating earlier results, we show that recent intracellular flux data for wild-type E. coli JM101 display excellent agreement with FBA predictions. Although the assumption of optimality for a wild-type bacterium is justifiable, the same argument may not be valid for genetically engineered knockouts or other bacterial strains that were not exposed to long-term evolutionary pressure. We address this point by introducing the method of minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA), whereby we test the hypothesis that knockout metabolic fluxes undergo a minimal redistribution with respect to the flux configuration of the wild type. MOMA employs quadratic programming to identify a point in flux space, which is closest to the wild-type point, compatibly with the gene deletion constraint. Comparing MOMA and FBA predictions to experimental flux data for E. coli pyruvate kinase mutant PB25, we find that MOMA displays a significantly higher correlation than FBA. Our method is further supported by experimental data for E. coli knockout growth rates. It can therefore be used for predicting the behavior of perturbed metabolic networks, whose growth performance is in general suboptimal. MOMA and its possible future extensions may be useful in understanding the evolutionary optimization of metabolism.},

  abstract = {Intersectionality is a term used to describe the intersecting effects of race, class, gender, and other marginalizing characteristics that contribute to social identity and affect health. Adverse health effects are thought to occur via social processes including discrimination and structural inequalities (i.e., reduced opportunities for education and income). Although intersectionality has been well-described conceptually, approaches to modeling it in quantitative studies of health outcomes are still emerging. Strategies to date have focused on modeling demographic characteristics as proxies for structural inequality. Our objective was to extend these methodological efforts by modeling intersectionality across three levels: structural, contextual, and interpersonal, consistent with a social-ecological framework. We conducted a secondary analysis of a database that included two components of a widely used survey instrument, the Everyday Discrimination Scale. We operationalized a meso- or interpersonal-level of intersectionality using two variables, the frequency score of discrimination experiences and the sum of characteristics listed as reasons for these (i.e., the person's race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, disability or pregnancy status, or physical appearance). We controlled for two structural inequality factors (low education, poverty) and three contextual factors (high crime neighborhood, racial minority status, and trauma exposures). The outcome variables we modeled were posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and a quality of life index score. We used data from 619 women who completed the Everyday Discrimination Scale for a perinatal study in the U.S. state of Michigan. Statistical results indicated that the two interpersonal-level variables (i.e., number of marginalized identities, frequency of discrimination) explained 15\% of variance in posttraumatic stress symptoms and 13\% of variance in quality of life scores, improving the predictive value of the models over those using structural inequality and contextual factors alone. This study's results point to instrument development ideas to improve the statistical modeling of intersectionality in health and social science research. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

It is a group- and facility-based program that meets for 90 minutes 3 times per week for 8 weeks (24 sessions total). We originally tested Fit and Strong! using physical therapists (PTs) as instructors but have transitioned to using nationally certified exercise instructors (CEIs) as part of an effort to translate Fit and Strong! into community-based settings, and have tested the impact of this shift in instruction type on participant outcomes.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: We used a 2-group design. The first 161 participants to sequentially enroll received instruction from PTs. The next 190 sequential enrollees received instruction from CEIs. All participants were assessed at baseline, at the conclusion of the 8-week Fit and Strong! program, and at the 6-month followup.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: We saw no significant differences by group on outcomes at 8 weeks or 6 months. Participants in both groups improved significantly with respect to lower-extremity strength, aerobic capacity, pain, stiffness, and physical function. Significant differences favoring the PT-led classes were seen on 2 of 5 mediators, self-efficacy for exercise and barriers adherence efficacy. Participant evaluations rated both types of instruction equally highly, attendance was identical, and no untoward health events were observed or reported under either instruction mode.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Outcomes under the 2 types of instruction are remarkably stable. These findings justify the use of CEIs in the future to extend the reach of the Fit and Strong! program.},

METHODS: This was a multicentre, retrospective study of adult patients with MSSA bacteraemia for {$>$}48 h. Standard treatment was considered monotherapy with cefazolin, oxacillin or nafcillin. Combination therapy was defined as the addition of ertapenem or meropenem to standard treatment for at least 24 h. The primary outcome was duration of bacteraemia defined as time from administration of an antibiotic with in vitro activity to first negative blood culture. Time to blood culture sterilization was compared through risk-set matching with aid of a propensity score. RESULTS: Overall, 238 patients were included; 66\% (157/238) received standard treatment and 34\% (81/238) received combination therapy. The median (IQR) time to carbapenem initiation was 4.7 (3.63-6.5) days. Patients who received combination therapy were younger (P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.012), more likely to have endocarditis (P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.034) and had longer median duration of bacteraemia (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001). After applying risk-set matching, patients who received combination therapy experienced faster time to blood culture sterilization compared with control patients [HR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.618 (95\% CI; 1.119-2.339) P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.011]. Using a paired hazard model, 90 day mortality rates were not statistically different among patients who received combination therapy versus matched controls [HR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.267 (95\% CI; 0.610-2.678), P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.608]. DISCUSSION: Carbapenem combination therapy resulted in faster time to blood culture sterilization, but no differences in overall mortality rates. Randomized trials are critical to determine the utility of carbapenem combination therapy.},

  abstract = {Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) data from race/ethnic subgroups remain limited, potentially masking subgroup-level heterogeneity. We evaluated differences in outcomes in Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI) and Hispanic/Latino subgroups compared with non-Hispanic White patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods: In the American Heart Association COVID-19 registry including 105 US hospitals, mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events in adults age {$\geq$}18 years hospitalized with COVID-19 between March-November 2020 were evaluated. Race/ethnicity groups included AAPI overall and subgroups (Chinese, Asian Indian, Vietnamese, and Pacific Islander), Hispanic/Latino overall and subgroups (Mexican, Puerto Rican), compared with non-Hispanic White (NHW). Results: Among 13,511 patients, 7\% were identified as AAPI (of whom 17\% were identified as Chinese, 9\% Asian Indian, 8\% Pacific Islander, and 7\% Vietnamese); 35\% as Hispanic (of whom 15\% were identified as Mexican and 1\% Puerto Rican); and 59\% as NHW. Mean [SD] age at hospitalization was lower in Asian Indian (60.4 [17.4] years), Pacific Islander (49.4 [16.7] years), and Mexican patients (57.4 [16.9] years), compared with NHW patients (66.9 [17.3] years, p{$<$}0.01). Mean age at death was lower in Mexican (67.7 [15.5] years) compared with NHW patients (75.5 [13.5] years, p{$<$}0.01). No differences in odds of mortality or MACE in AAPI or Hispanic patients relative to NHW patients were observed after adjustment for age. Conclusions: Pacific Islander, Asian Indian, and Mexican patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the AHA registry were significantly younger than NHW patients. COVID-19 infection leading to hospitalization may disproportionately burden some younger AAPI and Hispanic subgroups in the US.},

Here we report that polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN)-derived elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase-3 activate proMMP-2 through a mechanism that requires membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) expression. Immunoprecipitation of human PMN-conditioned medium with a mixture of antibodies to elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase-3 abolished proMMP-2 activation, whereas individual antibodies were ineffective. Incubation of HT1080 cells with either purified PMN elastase or cathepsin G or proteinase-3 resulted in dose-and time-dependent proMMP-2 activation. Addition of PMN-conditioned medium to MT1-MMP expressing cells resulted in increased proMMP-2 activation and in vitro invasion of extracellular matrix (ECM), but had no effect with cells that express no MT1-MMP. MMP-2 activation by PMN-conditioned medium or purified elastase was blocked by the elastase inhibitor alpha(1)-antitrypsin but not by Batimastat, an MMP inhibitor, showing that elastase activation of MMP-2 is not mediated by MMP activities. The PMN-conditioned medium-induced increase in cell invasion was blocked by Batimastat as well as by alpha(1)-antitrypsin, showing that PMN serine proteinases trigger a proteinase cascade that entails proMMP-2 activation: this gelatinase is the downstream effector of the proinvasive activity of PMN proteinases. These findings indicate a novel role for PMN-mediated inflammation in a variety of tissue remodeling processes including tumor invasion and angiogenesis.},

China has the largest number of HFRS cases worldwide, accounting for over 90\% of the total reported cases. In this paper, we used surveyed HFRS data and satellite imagery to conduct geostatistical analysis for investigating the associations of rapid urbanization, water bodies, and other factors on the spatiotemporal dynamics of HFRS from year 2005 to 2018 in Xi'an City, Northwest China. The results revealed an evident epidemic aggregation in the incidence of HFRS within Xi'an City with a phenomenal fluctuation in periodic time series. Rapid urbanization was found to greatly affect the HFRS incidence in two different time phases. HFRS caused by urbanization influences farmers to a lesser extent than it does to non-farmers. The association of water bodies with the HFRS incidence rate was found to be higher within the radii of 696.15 m and 1575.39 m, which represented significant thresholds. The results also showed that geomatics approaches can be used for spatiotemporally investigating the HFRS dynamic characteristics and supporting effective allocations of resources to formulate strategies for preventing epidemics.},

This comprehensive review of hepatitis B epidemiology and vaccines focuses on definitive and influential studies and highlights current trends, policies, and directions. HBV can be transmitted vertically, through sexual or household contact, or by unsafe injections, but chronic infections acquired during infancy or childhood account for a disproportionately large share of worldwide morbidity and mortality. Vaccination against HBV infection can be started at birth and provides long-term protection against infection in more than 90\% of healthy people. In the 1990s, many industrialized countries and a few less-developed countries implemented universal hepatitis B immunization and experienced measurable reductions in HBV-related disease. For example, in Taiwan, the prevalence of chronic infection in children declined by more than 90\%. Many resource-poor nations have recently initiated universal hepatitis B immunization programs with assistance from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization. Further progress towards the elimination of HBV transmission will require sustainable vaccination programs with improved vaccination coverage, practical methods of measuring the impact of vaccination programs, and targeted vaccination efforts for communities at high risk of infection.},

  abstract = {Engineering new tissues utilizing cell transplantation on biodegradable polymer matrices is an attractive approach to treat patients suffering from the loss or dysfunction of a number of tissues and organs. The matrices must maintain structural integrity during the process of tissue formation, and promote the vascularization of the developing tissue. A number of molecules (angiogenic factors) have been identified that promote the formation of new vascular beds from endothelial cells present within tissues, and the localized, controlled delivery of these factors from a matrix may allow an enhanced vascularization of engineered tissues. We have developed a gas foaming polymer processing approach that allows the fabrication of three-dimensional porous matrices from bioabsorbable materials (e.g., copolymers of lactide and glycolide [PLG]) without the use of organic solvents or high temperatures. The effects of several processing parameters (e.g., gas type, polymer composition and molecular weight) on the process were studied. Several gases (CO(2), N(2), He) were utilized in the fabrication process, but only CO(2) resulted in the formation of highly porous, structurally intact matrices. Crystalline polymers (polylactide and polyglycolide) did not form porous matrices, while amorphous copolymers (50:50, 75:25, and 85:15 ratio of lactide:glycolide) foamed to yield matrices with porosity up to 95\%. The mechanical properties of matrices were also regulated by the choice of PLG composition and molecular weight. Angiogenic factors (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor) were subsequently incorporated into matrices during the fabrication process, and released in a controlled manner. Importantly, the released growth factor retains over 90\% of its bioactivity. In summary, a promising system for the incorporation and delivery of angiogenic factors from three-dimensional, biodegradable polymer matrices has been developed, and the fabrication process allows incorporation under mild conditions.},

Overall cancer incidence trends (13 oldest SEER registries) are stable in women, but declining by 3.1\% per year in men (from 2009-2012), much of which is because of recent rapid declines in prostate cancer diagnoses. The cancer death rate has dropped by 23\% since 1991, translating to more than 1.7 million deaths averted through 2012. Despite this progress, death rates are increasing for cancers of the liver, pancreas, and uterine corpus, and cancer is now the leading cause of death in 21 states, primarily due to exceptionally large reductions in death from heart disease. Among children and adolescents (aged birth-19 years), brain cancer has surpassed leukemia as the leading cause of cancer death because of the dramatic therapeutic advances against leukemia.

The overall cancer death rate dropped continuously from 1991 to 2016 by a total of 27\%, translating into approximately 2,629,200 fewer cancer deaths than would have been expected if death rates had remained at their peak. Although the racial gap in cancer mortality is slowly narrowing, socioeconomic inequalities are widening, with the most notable gaps for the most preventable cancers. For example, compared with the most affluent counties, mortality rates in the poorest counties were 2-fold higher for cervical cancer and 40\% higher for male lung and liver cancers during 2012-2016. Some states are home to both the wealthiest and the poorest counties, suggesting the opportunity for more equitable dissemination of effective cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment strategies.

  abstract = {Health care policymakers have cited transportation barriers as key obstacles to providing health care to low-income suburbanites, particularly because suburbs have become home to a growing number of recent immigrants who are less likely to own cars than their neighbors. In a suburb of New York City, we conducted a pilot survey of low income, largely immigrant clients in four public clinics, to find out how much transportation difficulties limit their access to primary care. Clients were receptive to the opportunity to participate in the survey (response rate~=~94\%). Nearly one-quarter reported having transportation problems that had caused them to miss or reschedule a clinic appointment in the past. Difficulties included limited and unreliable local bus service, and a tenuous connection to a car. Our pilot work suggests that this population is willing to participate in a survey on this topic. Further, since even among those attending clinic there was significant evidence of past transportation problems, it suggests that a population-based survey would yield information about substantial transportation barriers to health care.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Direct acting antivirals (DAAs) have overcome many long-standing medical barriers to hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment (i.e. host characteristics and medical contraindications) and treatment outcome disparities that were associated with interferon regimens. The public health and clinical benefit of current and forthcoming DAA discoveries will be limited if efforts are not made to examine racial, psychological, and socioeconomic factors associated with being treated with DAAs. This study examined racial, psychological, and socioeconomic factors that facilitate and inhibit patients receiving DAAs for HCV. PATIENTS AND METHODS This was a single-center retrospective cohort study at a large urban tertiary center of patients (n=747) who were referred for evaluation and treatment of HCV. RESULTS Sixty-eight percent of patients were non-Hispanic White, 31\% were African American, and 1\% were of other ethnicities. The majority of patients received treatment, but 29\% (218/747) did not. Patients who were older [odds ratio (OR)=1.02, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.04] and insured (OR=2.73, 95\% CI: 1.12-6.97) were more likely to receive HCV treatment. Patients who were African American (OR=0.46, 95\% CI: 0.46-1.06), used drugs (OR=0.09, 95\% CI: 0.04-0.17), smoked (OR=0.55, 95\% CI: 0.37-0.81), and used alcohol (OR=0.11, 95\% CI: 0.06-0.20) were less likely to receive HCV treatment. CONCLUSION Though DAAs have eliminated many historically, long-standing medical barriers to HCV treatment, several racial, psychological and socioeconomic barriers, and disparities remain. Consequently, patients who are African American, uninsured, and actively use drugs and alcohol will suffer from increased HCV-related morbidity and mortality in the coming years if deliberate public health and clinical efforts are not made to facilitate access to DAAs.},

These studies have also paved the way toward several well established preventive measures including HBV vaccination, HBV treatment, HCV treatment and HCC surveillance, and potential chemoprevention using statins, metformin or coffee. However, the effectiveness of HCC prevention in clinical practice and at the population level has lagged behind due to patient, provider, system, and societal factors.

The study objective was to characterize guideline-consistent hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance rates and identify determinants of hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance among a racially and socioeconomically diverse cohort of cirrhotic patients. METHODS: We retrospectively characterized hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance among cirrhotic patients followed between July 2008 and July 2011 at an urban safety-net hospital. Inconsistent surveillance was defined as at least 1 screening ultrasound during the 3-year period, annual surveillance was defined as screening ultrasounds every 12 months, and biannual surveillance was defined as screening ultrasounds every 6 months. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify predictors of surveillance. RESULTS: Of 904 cirrhotic patients, 603 (67\%) underwent inconsistent surveillance. Failure to recognize cirrhosis was a significant barrier to surveillance use (P {$<$} .001). Inconsistent surveillance was associated with insurance status (odds ratio [OR], 1.43; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.98), multiple primary care visits per year (OR, 2.63; 95\% CI, 1.86-3.71), multiple hepatology visits per year (OR, 3.75; 95\% CI, 2.64-5.33), African American race (OR, 0.61; 95\% CI, 0.42-0.99), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis cause (OR, 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.37-0.98), and extrahepatic cancer (OR, 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.24-0.77). Only 98 (13.4\%) of 730 patients underwent annual surveillance, and only 13 (1.7\%) of 786 had biannual surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: Only 13\% of patients with cirrhosis receive annual surveillance, and less than 2\% of patients receive biannual surveillance. There are racial and socioeconomic disparities, with lower rates of hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance among African Americans and underinsured patients.},

  abstract = {The timing of DNA synthesis, mitosis and cell division is regulated by a complex network of biochemical reactions that control the activities of a family of cyclin-dependent kinases. The temporal dynamics of this reaction network is typically modeled by nonlinear differential equations describing the rates of the component reactions. This approach provides exquisite details about molecular regulatory processes but is hampered by the need to estimate realistic values for the many kinetic constants that determine the reaction rates. It is difficult to estimate these kinetic constants from available experimental data. To avoid this problem, modelers often resort to 'qualitative' modeling strategies, such as Boolean switching networks, but these models describe only the coarsest features of cell cycle regulation. In this paper we describe a hybrid approach that combines the best features of continuous differential equations and discrete Boolean networks. Cyclin abundances are tracked by piecewise linear differential equations for cyclin synthesis and degradation. Cyclin synthesis is regulated by transcription factors whose activities are represented by discrete variables (0 or 1) and likewise for the activities of the ubiquitin-ligating enzyme complexes that govern cyclin degradation. The discrete variables change according to a predetermined sequence, with the times between transitions determined in part by cyclin accumulation and degradation and as well by exponentially distributed random variables. The model is evaluated in terms of flow cytometry measurements of cyclin proteins in asynchronous populations of human cell lines. The few kinetic constants in the model are easily estimated from the experimental data. Using this hybrid approach, modelers can quickly create quantitatively accurate, computational models of protein regulatory networks in cells.},

The incidence and mortality of HCC are increasing in most Western countries as a result of an ageing cohort infected with chronic hepatitis C, and are expected to continue to rise as a consequence of the obesity epidemic. Chemopreventive strategies aimed at decreasing the risk or delaying the onset of HCC are needed. Universal immunization against HBV and antiviral therapy against HBV and HCV in patients with established disease has consistently been associated with reduced HCC risk, especially in patients who achieve sustained virologic response. However, the cost-effectiveness of antiviral therapy for primary HCC prevention is not known. Several commonly prescribed medications seem promising as chemopreventive agents against HCC, including statins, antidiabetic medications and aspirin. Dietary agents such as coffee, vitamin E and fish oil as well as phytochemicals might also be associated with reduced risk of HCC. Though randomized controlled trials are ideally needed to firmly establish efficacy, such chemoprevention trials are logistically and ethically challenging. Well-designed, prospective, population-based cohort studies might provide the best evidence for chemopreventive efficacy of these agents.},

We tested the hypothesis that VEGF delivered by scaffolds coated with a sub-micron thick layer of immobilized heparin would accelerate angiogenesis. The bioactivity of retained VEGF was confirmed by its phosphorylation of VEGF receptor-2. After 7 and 14 days of subcutaneous implantation in mice, the heparin-PCL scaffolds loaded with VEGF displayed significantly higher infiltration of blood vessels which traversed the entire scaffold thickness (2 mm). The stability and function of the newly formed vessels were confirmed by smooth muscle cell coverage and vessel perfusability, respectively. The contribution of individual components was assessed by varying the VEGF dose and heparin thickness. Prolonging the cross-linking reaction on PCL scaffolds resulted in higher heparin content, thicker heparin layer, and higher VEGF retention. While a dose dependent angiogenic response was observed with VEGF, higher amount of cross-linked heparin did not translate into additional improvement in angiogenesis for a given dose of VEGF. The synergism of immobilized heparin and VEGF in stimulating angiogenesis was observed in vivo.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immigrants are a growing segment of the US population. In 2003, there were 33.5 million immigrants, accounting for 12\% of the total US population. Despite a rapid increase in their numbers, little information exists as to how immigrants' health and mortality profile has changed over time. In this study, we analysed trends in social and behavioural characteristics, life expectancy, and mortality patterns of immigrants and the US-born from 1979 to 2003. METHODS: We used national mortality and census data (1979-2003) and 1993 and 2003 National Health Interview Surveys to examine nativity differentials over time in health and social characteristics. Life tables, age-adjusted death rates, and logistic regression were used to examine nativity differentials. RESULTS: During 1979-81, immigrants had 2.3 years longer life expectancy than the US-born (76.2 vs 73.9 years). The difference increased to 3.4 years in 1999-2001 (80.0 vs 76.6 years). Nativity differentials in mortality increased over time for major cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory diseases, unintentional injuries, and suicide, with immigrants experiencing generally lower mortality than the US-born in each period. Specifically, in 1999-2001, immigrants had at least 30\% lower mortality from lung and oesophageal cancer, COPD, suicide, and HIV/AIDS, but at least 50\% higher mortality from stomach and liver cancer than the US-born. Nativity differentials in mortality, health, and behavioural characteristics varied substantially by ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: Growing ethnic heterogeneity of the immigrant population, and its migration selectivity and continuing advantages in behavioural characteristics may partly explain the overall widening health gaps between immigrants and the US-born.},

This article considers the case when at least one of the samples is selected by a complex design involving, e.g., multistage sampling. A "pseudo"-maximum likelihood estimator of a population total or a mean for such dual frame surveys is proposed. An advantage of the proposed estimator is that the same weights are used for all the variables, unlike the estimators of Hartley and Fuller and Burmeister. Asymptotic properties of the estimator are studied, including its efficiency. An alternative "single frame" estimator, based on the design induced by the two separate designs, is also studied. Results of a limited simulation study indicate that our estimator is essentially as efficient as those of Hartley and Fuller and Burmeister and can lead to significant efficiency gains over the single frame estimator.},

  abstract = {Advances in the field of bioinformatics have led to reconstruction of genome-scale networks for a number of key organisms. The application of physicochemical constraints to these stoichiometric networks allows researchers, through methods such as flux balance analysis, to highlight key sets of reactions necessary to achieve particular objectives. The key benefits of constraint-based analysis lie in the minimal knowledge required to infer systemic properties. However, network degeneracy leads to a large number of flux distributions that satisfy any objective; moreover, these distributions may be dominated by biologically irrelevant internal cycles. By examining the geometry underlying the problem, we define two methods for finding a unique solution within the space of all possible flux distributions; such a solution contains no internal cycles, and is representative of the space as a whole. The first method draws on typical geometric knowledge, but cannot be applied to large networks because of the high computational complexity of the problem. Thus a second method, an iteration of linear programs which scales easily to the genome scale, is defined. The algorithm is run on four recent genome-scale models, and unique flux solutions are found. The algorithm set out here will allow researchers in flux balance analysis to exchange typical solutions to their models in a reproducible format. Moreover, having found a single solution, statistical analyses such as correlations may be performed.},

  abstract = {Objective To test whether there were fewer missed medical appointments (``no-shows'') for patients and clinics affected by a significant public transportation expansion. Study setting A new light rail line was opened in a major metropolitan area in June 2014. We obtained electronic health records data from an integrated health delivery system in the area with over three million appointments at 97 clinics between 2013 and 2016. Study design We used a difference-in-differences research design to compare whether no-show appointment rates differentially changed among patients and clinics located near versus far from the new light rail line after it opened. Models included fixed effects to account for underlying differences across clinics, patient zip codes, and time. Data extraction methods We obtained data from an electronic health records system representing all appointments scheduled at 97 outpatient clinics in this system. We excluded same-day, urgent care, and canceled appointments. Principal findings The probability of no-show visits differentially declined by 0.5 percentage points (95\% confidence interval [CI]: -0.9 to -0.1), or 4.5\% relative to baseline, for patients living near the new light rail compared to those living far from it, after the light rail opened. The effects were stronger among patients covered by Medicaid (-1.6 percentage points [95\% CI: -2.4 to -0.8] or 9.5\% relative to baseline). Conclusions Improvements to public transit may improve access to health care, especially for people with low incomes.},

Here, we propose GInPipe, a method that rapidly reconstructs SARS-CoV-2 incidence profiles solely from publicly available, time-stamped viral genomes. We validate GInPipe against simulated outbreaks and elaborate phylodynamic analyses. Using available sequence data, we reconstruct incidence histories for Denmark, Scotland, Switzerland, and Victoria (Australia) and demonstrate, how to use the method to investigate the effects of changing testing policies on case ascertainment. Specifically, we find that under-reporting was highest during summer 2020 in Europe, coinciding with more liberal testing policies at times of low testing capacities. Due to the increased use of real-time sequencing, it is envisaged that GInPipe can complement established surveillance tools to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In post-pandemic times, when diagnostic efforts are decreasing, GInPipe may facilitate the detection of hidden infection dynamics.},

Many of the 2.7-3.9 million persons living with HCV infection are unaware they are infected and do not receive care (e.g., education, counseling, and medical monitoring) and treatment. CDC estimates that although persons born during 1945-1965 comprise an estimated 27\% of the population, they account for approximately three fourths of all HCV infections in the United States, 73\% of HCV-associated mortality, and are at greatest risk for hepatocellular carcinoma and other HCV-related liver disease. With the advent of new therapies that can halt disease progression and provide a virologic cure (i.e., sustained viral clearance following completion of treatment) in most persons, targeted testing and linkage to care for infected persons in this birth cohort is expected to reduce HCV-related morbidity and mortality. CDC is augmenting previous recommendations for HCV testing (CDC. Recommendations for prevention and control of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and HCV-related chronic disease. MMWR 1998;47[No. RR-19]) to recommend one-time testing without prior ascertainment of HCV risk for persons born during 1945-1965, a population with a disproportionately high prevalence of HCV infection and related disease. Persons identified as having HCV infection should receive a brief screening for alcohol use and intervention as clinically indicated, followed by referral to appropriate care for HCV infection and related conditions. These recommendations do not replace previous guidelines for HCV testing that are based on known risk factors and clinical indications. Rather, they define an additional target population for testing: persons born during 1945-1965. CDC developed these recommendations with the assistance of a work group representing diverse expertise and perspectives. The recommendations are informed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework, an approach that provides guidance and tools to define the research questions, conduct the systematic review, assess the overall quality of the evidence, and determine strength of the recommendations. This report is intended to serve as a resource for health-care professionals, public health officials, and organizations involved in the development, implementation, and evaluation of prevention and clinical services.

An expository review of these methods is presented. It is concluded that data splitting is an effective method of model validation when it is not practical to collect new data to test the model. The DUPLEX algorithm, developed by R. W. Kennard, is recommended for dividing the data into the estimation set and prediction set when there is no obvious variable such as time to use as a basis to split the data.

Transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics have, individually, been used in wide-ranging studies involving cell lines, tissues, model organisms, and human subjects. Nonetheless, despite the fact that their power lies in the global acquisition of parallel data streams, these methods continue to be employed separately. We highlight work done to merge transcriptomics and metabolomics technologies to study zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryogenesis. We combine information from three bioanalytical platforms, that is, DNA microarrays, (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR), and mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics, to identify and provide insights into the organism's developmental regulators. We apply a customized approach to the analysis of such time-ordered measurements to provide temporal profiles that depict the modulation of metabolites and gene transcription. Initially, the three data sets were analyzed individually but later they were fused to highlight the advantages gained through such an integrated approach. Unique challenges posed by fusion of such data are discussed given differences in the measurement error structures, the wide dynamic range for the molecular species, and the analytical platforms used to measure them (i.e., fluorescence ratios, NMR, and MS intensities). Our data analysis reveals that changes in transcript levels at specific developmental stages correlate with previously published data with over 90\% accuracy. In addition, transcript profiles exhibited trends that were similar to the accumulation of metabolites over time. Profiles for metabolites such as choline-like compounds (Trimethylamine-N-oxide, phosphocholine, betaine), creatinine/creatine, and other metabolites involved in energy metabolism exhibited a steady increase from 15 hours post fertilization (hpf) to 48 hpf. Other metabolite and transcript profiles were transiently rising and then falling back to baseline. The "house keeping" metabolites such as branched chain amino acids exhibited a steady presence throughout embryogenesis. Although the transcript profiling corresponds to only 16\,384 genes, a subset of the total number of genes in the zebrafish genome, we identified examples where gene transcript and metabolite profiles correlate with one another, reflective of a relationship between gene and metabolite regulation over the course of embryogenesis.},

Increasingly, insurers and health care delivery systems subsidize transportation services for patients. This systematic review synthesizes existing research on nonemergency medical transportation interventions.         Methods:~         We searched 3 databases (Embase, PubMed, Google) for studies of health care sector-sponsored programs that provided patients assistance with nonemergency transportation and directly assessed the impact of transportation assistance on health and health care utilization outcomes. Studies meeting inclusion criteria were graded for quality using standard grading criteria.         Findings:~         Eight studies met all inclusion criteria. Most were rated as low quality. All studies included examined process or health care utilization outcomes, such as uptake of transportation services, return for follow-up, or missed appointment rates; only 1 included health outcomes, such as illness severity and blood pressure. Results were mixed. More rigorous studies showed low patient uptake of transportation services and inconsistent impacts on health and utilization outcomes.         Conclusions:~         Despite considerable interest in subsidizing transportation services to improve health for patients facing transportation barriers, little rigorously conducted research has demonstrated the impact of transportation services on health or health care utilization. Some extant literature suggests that transportation assistance is more likely to be effective when offered with other interventions to reduce social and economic barriers to health.},

Data were extracted for 16,121 patients with HCC diagnosed between 1998 and 2004. Twenty-three percent of patients underwent surgical therapy (9.5\% resection, 7.8\% ablation, 6\% transplant); the proportion of patients treated with surgical therapy increased approximately 9\% over the study period. On multivariate analysis, female sex, younger age, and smaller solitary tumors were associated with increased utilization of surgical therapy. Blacks and Hispanics were 24-27\% less likely to receive surgical therapy than white individuals (P{$<$}0.001). Racial and geographic disparities persisted despite the adjustment for Health Service Area and limitation of the cohort to small localized HCC. Blacks were especially disadvantaged in the utilization of liver transplant for small HCC (OR=0.42, P{$<$}0.001). Further investigation to understand the etiology of these profound racial and geographic disparities is essential to ensure equitable provision of surgical therapies, which provide the only potentially curative treatments for HCC.},

The ACS is now the principal source of high-resolution geographic information about the U.S. population. The margins of error on ACS census tract-level data are on average 75 percent larger than those of the corresponding 2000 long-form estimate. The practical implications of this increase is that data are sometimes so imprecise that they are difficult to use. This paper explains why the ACS tract and block group estimates have large margins of error. Statistical concepts are explained in plain English. ACS margins of error are attributed to specific methodological decisions made by the Census Bureau. These decisions are best seen as compromises that attempt to balance financial constraints against concerns about data quality, timeliness, and geographic precision. In addition, demographic and geographic patterns in ACS data quality are identified. These patterns are associated with demographic composition of census tracts. Understanding the fundamental causes of uncertainty in the survey suggests a number of geographic strategies for improving the usability and quality ACS.},

Primary cancers of the liver in adults are of two main histological types: hepatocellular carcinoma, which is derived from hepatocytes, and cholangiocarcinoma, which is derived from the epithelial lining of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Hepatocellular cancer is a frequently occurring tumor in individuals in many developing countries, where several important risk factors have been demonstrated, including chronic infection with hepatitis B and C viruses and other environmental factors, such as exposure to aflatoxin, consumption of alcohol, and cigarette smoking. By contrast, cholangiocarcinoma is less common, accounting for only 7.7\% of malignant tumors of the liver in the United States. However, in parts of Southeast Asia, cholangiocarcinoma occurs more frequently; it is responsible for more than 60\% of liver tumors in northeastern Thailand. The geographic distribution worldwide coincides with endemic areas of the liver flukes, Opisthorchis viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis. The interaction between genes and the environment and the interplay of environmental factors, which include diet and other lifestyle parameters, illustrate the complexity underlying susceptibility.},

Here, we take a phylogenetic and phylodynamic approach to single-cell biology. We explain how ``tree thinking'' is important to the interpretation of the growing body of cell-level data and how ecological null models can benefit statistical hypothesis testing. Experimental progress in cell biology should be accompanied by theoretical developments if we are to exploit fully the dynamical information in single-cell data.}

Methods: Ten pediatric patients with a penetrating skull injury as a result of a dog bite, treated at our institution between 1992 and 2010, were identified and analyzed descriptively. A literature review of the 21 case reports was also conducted. Results and Conclusion: Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent complications from hemorrhage or infections. Based on our results, we recommend obtaining a head CT for all victims sustaining injuries to the head, early use of broad spectrum antibiotics, debridement and irrigation of tissue, and follow-up to identify late infectious complications.},

The focus of this guideline is the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of diverse SSTIs ranging from minor superficial infections to life-threatening infections such as necrotizing fasciitis. In addition, because of an increasing number of immunocompromised hosts worldwide, the guideline addresses the wide array of SSTIs that occur in this population. These guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical skills in promptly diagnosing SSTIs, identifying the pathogen, and administering effective treatments in a timely fashion.}

In the second phase, group interviews with people living in poverty (n = 52) were conducted. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Diverse health-related services were used to meet basic and health needs, to maintain human contact, and to cope with life's challenges. Use of services depended on proximity, affordability, convenience, information, and providers' attitudes and behaviours. Use was impeded by inequities based on income status. To promote the health of people living in poverty, nurses and other health professionals can enhance the accessibility and quality of services, improve their interactions with people living in poverty, provide information about available programs, offer coordinated community-based services, collaborate with other sectors, and advocate for more equitable services and policies.},

Vascular graft scaffolds have been fabricated using electrospun polymer blends of Type I collagen, elastin from ligamentum nuchae, and poly (d,l-lactide-co-glycolide). This study demonstrates improved electrospinning characteristics versus previous studies by increasing polymer concentration and adding PLGA to the polymer blend. Additionally, new in vitro biocompatibility and mechanical testing data is presented. The scaffolds possess tissue composition and mechanical properties similar to native vessels. The electrospun vessel matrix is biocompatible and does not elicit local or systemic toxic effects when implanted in vivo.

OBJECTIVE To determine the relationship between glycemic control and the driving distance from home to the site of primary care. DESIGN Cross-sectional analysis of data from the Vermont Diabetes Information System. PARTICIPANTS Nine-hundred and seventy-three adults with diabetes in primary care. The mean age was 64.9 years, 57\% were female, and 18.4\% used insulin. MEASUREMENTS Hemoglobin A1c, shortest driving distance from a patient's home to the site of primary care calculated by geographic software, self-reported gender, age, education, income, marital status, race, insurance coverage, diabetic complications, and use of insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents. RESULTS Controlling for social, demographic, seasonal, and treatment variables, there was a positive, significant relationship between glycemic control and driving distance ({$\beta$}=+0.07\%/10 km, P {$<$}.001, 95\% confidence interval [CI]=+0.03, +0.11). Driving distance had a stronger association with glycemic control among insulin users ({$\beta$}=+0.22\%/10 km, P =.016, 95\% CI=+0.04, +0.40) than among noninsulin users ({$\beta$}=+0.06\%/10 km, P =.006, 95\% CI=+0.02, +0.10). CONCLUSION Longer driving distances from home to the site of primary care were associated with poorer glycemic control in this population of older, rural subjects. While the mechanism for this effect is not known, providers should be aware of this potential barrier to good glycemic control.},

Response rates and demographic and sexual risk profiles are compared by venue type.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: More than 90\% of the men approached were screened. Among eligible men, participation rates exceeded 82\%. Participation was higher at special events and gay venues compared with nongay venues (P {$<$} .05). Young MSM in nongay venues were less likely to self-identify as gay (P {$<$} .01) or to report recent anal sex with a male (P {$<$} .10). Condom use did not vary by venue type but was lower with women than with men. If surveys had been limited to gay venues, about half of the young MSM surveyed in nongay venues would have been missed.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Time-space sampling of a relatively "hidden" minority young MSM population can be successful across a range of venues. However, the benefits of greater outreach must be weighed against the costs incurred recruiting participants in nongay venues.},

We aimed to describe the association between race/ethnicity and effectiveness of new direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens in the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system nationally. We identified 21,095 HCV-infected patients (11,029 [52\%] white, 6,171 [29\%] black, 1,187 [6\%] Hispanic, 348 [2\%] Asian/Pacific Islander/American Indian/Alaska Native [Asian/PI/AI/AN] and 2,360 [11\%] declined/missing race or ethnicity) who initiated antiviral treatment with regimens containing sofosbuvir (SOF), simeprevir\,+\,sofosbuvir (SMV+SOF), ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) or paritaprevir/ombitasvir/ritonavir/dasabuvir (PrOD), during the 18-month period from 01/01/2014 to 06/30/2015. Overall SVR rates were 89.8\% (95\% CI 89.2-90.4) in white, 89.8\% (95\% CI 89.0-90.6) in black, 86.0\% (95\% CI 83.7-88.0) in Hispanic, and 90.7\% (95\% CI 87.0-93.5) in Asian/PI/AI/AN patients. However, after adjustment for baseline characteristics, black (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.77, p-value{$<$}0.001) and Hispanic patients (AOR 0.76, p-value=0.007) were less likely to achieve SVR than white patients, a difference that was not explained by early treatment discontinuations. Among genotype 1-infected patients treated with LDV/SOF monotherapy, black patients had significantly lower SVR than white patients when treated for 8 weeks but not when treated for 12 weeks. CONCLUSION DAAs produce high SVR rates in white, black, Hispanic, and Asian/PI/AI/AN patients. However, after adjusting for baseline characteristics, black race and Hispanic ethnicity remain independent predictors of treatment failure. Short, 8-week LDV/SOF monotherapy regimens should perhaps be avoided in black patients with genotype 1 HCV. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

It maintains both innate and adaptive immunity and protects the body from microbial infections. The removal of the spleen as a treatment method was initiated from the early 1500s for traumatic injuries, even before the physiology of spleen was properly understood. Splenectomy has therapeutic effects in many conditions such as sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Hodgkin's disease, and lymphoma. However, it increases the risk of infections and, in some cases, can lead to a case of severe sepsis known as overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI), which has a very high mortality rate. Encapsulated bacteria form a major proportion of the invading organisms, of which the most common is Streptococcus pneumoniae. OPSI is a medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis (with blood cultures and sensitivity, blood glucose levels, renal function tests, and electrolyte levels) and management with fluid resuscitation along with immediate administration of empirical antimicrobials. OPSI can be prevented by educating patients, vaccination, and antibiotic prophylaxis. This article summarizes the anatomy and physiology of the spleen and highlights its important functions. It primarily focuses on the pathophysiology of OPSI, its current management, and prevention strategies.},

  abstract = {Coffee use has consistently been associated with lower serum liver enzyme levels and a reduced risk of liver cirrhosis. A limited number of cohort and case-control studies also suggest a decreased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among coffee drinkers, but mostly without consideration of hepatitis virus infection. In the present case-control study, we recruited 209 incident HCC cases and three different controls (1308 community controls, 275 hospital controls, and 381 patients with chronic liver disease [CLD] without HCC), all of whom were aged 40-79 years and residents of Saga Prefecture, Japan. A questionnaire survey elicited information on coffee use during the last 1-2 years and 10 years before, and plasma hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies to hepatitis C virus were tested for all but community controls. After adjustment for sex, age, heavy alcohol use, smoking status and hepatitis virus markers (except for community controls), coffee use during the last 1-2 years was associated with a decreased risk against any control group. For coffee use 10 years before, comparison between HCC cases and either community controls or CLD patients revealed a decreased risk; adjusted odds ratios for occasional use, 1-2 cups/day and {$>$} or =3 cups/day compared with no use were 0.33, 0.27 and 0.22 (P trend {$<$} 0.001), respectively, against community controls, and 0.86, 0.62 and 0.53 (P trend = 0.05), respectively, against CLD patients. These results suggest that coffee may protect against the development of HCC, yet further elaborate studies (hopefully, intervention studies) are warranted to corroborate these findings.},

  abstract = {Multipurpose cohort studies have demonstrated that coffee consumption reduces the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Given that one of the main causes of HCC is hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, we examined the effect of caffeic acid, a major organic acid derived from coffee, on the propagation of HCV using an in vitro naive HCV particle-infection and production system within human hepatoma-derived Huh-7.5.1-8 cells. When cells were treated with 1\% coffee extract or 0.1\% caffeic acid for 1-h post HCV infection, the amount of HCV particles released into the medium at 3 and 4 days post-infection considerably decreased. In addition, HCV-infected cells cultured with 0.001\% caffeic acid for 4 days, also released less HCV particles into the medium. Caffeic acid treatment inhibited the initial stage of HCV infection (i.e., between virion entry and the translation of the RNA genome) in both HCV genotypes 1b and 2a. These results suggest that the treatment of cells with caffeic acid may inhibit HCV propagation.},

We conducted yearly cross-sectional summaries of mammography experience and late-stage (regional or distant Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Reporting (SEER) stage) breast cancer occurrence for all of the health-plan women ages {$>$} or = 40 (1986-1998). We estimated the odds of late-stage breast cancer among health-plan and surrounding community women because it was too early to compare changes in mortality. We also estimated the odds of late-stage disease (1995-1998) associated with program enrollment and mammography screening among health-plan women. We found that mammography-within-two-years increased within the health plan from 25.9\% to 51.2\% among women ages 40-49 and from 32.9\% to 74.7\% among women ages{$>$} or = 50. Health-plan late-stage rates were lower than those in the surrounding community [ages 40-49: odds ratio (OR), 0.87; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.77-0.99; ages 50-79: OR, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.80-0.92] and declined parallel to the community. Among health-plan cancer cases, women ages {$>$} or = 43 who were enrolled in the screening program and who had at least one program mammogram were less likely to have late-stage disease compared with the women not enrolled in the program (OR, 0.31; 95\% CI, 0.16-0.61) but the odds of late-stage was also reduced among program-enrolled women not receiving program mammograms (OR, 0.45; 95\% CI, 0.21-0.95). We concluded that enrollment in organized screening is associated with increased likelihood of mammography and reduced odds of late-stage breast cancer. Addressing the concerns of un-enrolled women and those without mammograms offers an opportunity for further late-stage disease reduction.},

  abstract = {Objective: To examine the relationship between self-reported and clinical measurements for height and weight in adults aged 18 years and over and to determine the bias associated with using household telephone surveys. Method: A representative population sample of adults aged 18 years and over living in the north-west region of Adelaide (n=1,537) were recruited to the biomedical cohort study in 2002/03. A computerassisted telephone interviewing (CATI) system was used to collect self-reported height and weight. Clinical measures were obtained when the cohort study participants attended a clinic for biomedical tests. Result: Adults over-estimated their height (by 1.4 cm) and under-estimated their weight (by 1.7 kg). Using the self-report figures the prevalence of overweight/ obese was 56.0\% but this prevalence estimate increased to 65.3\% when clinical measurements were used. The discrepancy in self-reported height and weight is partly explained by 1) a rounding effect (rounding height and weight to the nearest 0 or 5) and 2) older persons (65+ years) considerably over-estimating their height. Conclusion: Self-report is important in monitoring overweight and obesity; however, it must be recognised that prevalence estimates obtained are likely to understate the problem. Implications: The public health focus on obesity is warranted, but self-report estimates, commonly used to highlight the obesity epidemic, are likely to be underestimations. Self-report would be a more reliable measure if people did not round their measurements and if older persons more accurately knew their height.},

  abstract = {Public subsidy of transit services has increased dramatically in recent years, with little effect on overall ridership. Quite obviously, a clear understanding of the factors influencing transit ridership is central to decisions on investments in and the pricing and deployment of transit services. Yet the literature about the causes of transit use is quite spotty; most previous aggregate analyses of transit ridership have examined just one or a few systems, have not included many of the external, control variables thought to influence transit use, and have not addressed the simultaneous relationship between transit service supply and consumption. This study addresses each of these shortcomings by (1) conducting a cross-sectional analysis of transit use in 265 US urbanized areas, (2) testing dozens of variables measuring regional geography, metropolitan economy, population characteristics, auto/highway system characteristics, and transit system characteristics, and (3) constructing two-stage simultaneous equation regression models to account for simultaneity between transit service supply and consumption. We find that most of the variation in transit ridership among urbanized areas - in both absolute and relative terms - can be explained by factors outside of the control of public transit systems: (1) regional geography (specifically, area of urbanization, population, population density, and regional location in the US), (2) metropolitan economy (specifically, personal/household income), (3) population characteristics (specifically, the percent college students, recent immigrants, and Democratic voters in the population), and (4) auto/highway system characteristics (specifically, the percent carless households and non-transit/non-SOV trips, including commuting via carpools, walking, biking, etc.). While these external factors clearly go a long way toward determining the overall level of transit use in an urbanized area, we find that transit policies do make a significant difference. The observed range in both fares and service frequency in our sample could account for at least a doubling (or halving) of transit use in a given urbanized area. Controlling for the fact that public transit use is strongly correlated with urbanized area size, about 26\% of the observed variance in per capita transit patronage across US urbanized areas is explained in the models presented here by service frequency and fare levels. The observed influence of these two factors is consistent with both the literature and intuition: frequent service draws passengers, and high fares drive them away. \copyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper proposes a theory of estimation of natural direct and indirect effects in two important semiparametric models for a failure time outcome. The underlying survival model for the marginal total effect and thus for the direct and indirect effects, can either be a marginal structural Cox proportional hazards model, or a marginal structural additive hazards model. The proposed theory delivers new estimators for mediation analysis in each of these models, with appealing robustness properties. Specifically, in order to guarantee ignorability with respect to the exposure and mediator variables, the approach, which is multiply robust, allows the investigator to use several flexible working models to adjust for confounding by a large number of pre-exposure variables. Multiple robustness is appealing because it only requires a subset of working models to be correct for consistency; furthermore, the analyst need not know which subset of working models is in fact correct to report valid inferences. Finally, a novel semiparametric sensitivity analysis technique is developed for each of these models, to assess the impact on inference, of a violation of the assumption of ignorability of the mediator.},

A causal framework has recently been proposed for mediation analysis, which gives rise to new definitions, formal identification results and novel estimators of direct and indirect effects. In the present paper, the author describes a new inverse odds ratio-weighted approach to estimate so-called natural direct and indirect effects. The approach, which uses as a weight the inverse of an estimate of the odds ratio function relating the exposure and the mediator, is universal in that it can be used to decompose total effects in a number of regression models commonly used in practice. Specifically, the approach may be used for effect decomposition in generalized linear models with a nonlinear link function, and in a number of other commonly used models such as the Cox proportional hazards regression for a survival outcome. The approach is simple and can be implemented in standard software provided a weight can be specified for each observation. An additional advantage of the method is that it easily incorporates multiple mediators of a categorical, discrete or continuous nature. Copyright \copyright{} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We hypothesized that among an urban population of children with asthma, higher spatial accessibility to primary care pediatric services would be associated with (1) more scheduled primary care visits for asthma, (2) better longitudinal asthma management, and (3) fewer unscheduled visits for asthma care. METHODS. We enrolled children aged 12 months to 17 years, inclusive, who sought acute asthma care in an urban pediatric ED. Eligibility criteria included a history of unscheduled visits for asthma in the previous year. We collected comprehensive data on each participant's asthma medical management and prior health care utilization. In addition, we calculated each participant's spatial accessibility to primary care pediatric services, reported as a provider-to-population ratio at their place of residence. Patients then were stratified by their spatial accessibility to care and compared with respect to measures of medical management and health care utilization. RESULTS. Among the 411 eligible participants, the spatial accessibility of primary care ranged from 7.4 to 350.2 full-time pediatric providers per 100 000 children Ͻ18 years of age, with a mean of 57.7 Ϯ 40.0. Patients in the middle and highest tertiles of spatial accessibility made significantly more scheduled visits for asthma care than patients in the lowest tertile. There were no differences among tertiles of accessibility with respect to asthma management or with respect to unscheduled visits for asthma care. CONCLUSIONS. Within this highly urban, largely disadvantaged and minority population of children with chronic asthma, patients with higher spatial accessibility to primary care services made significantly more scheduled visits for asthma care.},

The slow-replicating human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) blocks premature death of host cells prior to completion of the infection cycle. In this study, we report that the HCMV UL38 gene encodes a cell death inhibitory protein. A mutant virus lacking the pUL38 coding sequence, ADdlUL38, grew poorly in human fibroblasts, failed to accumulate viral DNA to wild-type levels, and induced excessive death of infected cells. Cells expressing pUL38 were resistant to cell death upon infection and effectively supported the growth of ADdlUL38. Cells infected with the pUL38-deficient virus showed morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis, including cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, vesicle release, and chromatin condensation and fragmentation. The proteolytic cleavage of two key enzymes involved in apoptosis, namely, caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, was activated upon ADdlUL38 infection, and the cleavage was blocked in cells expressing pUL38. The pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK largely restored the growth of ADdlUL38 in normal fibroblasts, indicating that the defective growth of the mutant virus mainly resulted from premature death of host cells. Furthermore, cells expressing pUL38 were resistant to cell death induced by a mutant adenovirus lacking the antiapoptotic E1B-19K protein or by thapsigargin, which disrupts calcium homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum. Taken together, these results indicate that the HCMV protein pUL38 suppresses apoptosis, blocking premature death of host cells to facilitate efficient virus replication.},

However, because sex is such a common behavior and the reservoir of HCV-infected individuals is sizable, sexual transmission of HCV likely contributes to the total burden of infection in the United States. Risk of HCV transmission by sexual contact differs by the type of sexual relationship. Persons in long-term monogamous partnerships are at lower risk of HCV acquisition (0\% to 0.6\% per year) than persons with multiple partners or those at risk for sexually transmitted diseases (0.4\% to 1.8\% per year). This difference may reflect differences in sexual risk behaviors or differences in rates of exposure to nonsexual sources of HCV, such as injection drug use or shared razors and toothbrushes. In seroprevalence studies in monogamous, heterosexual partners of HCV-infected, HIV-negative persons, the frequency of antibody-positive and genotype-concordant couples is 2.8\% to 11\% in Southeast Asia, 0\% to 6.3\% in Northern Europe, and 2.7\% in the United States. Among individuals at risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), the median seroprevalence of antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) is 4\% (range, 1.6\% to 25.5\%). HIV coinfection appears to increase the rate of HCV transmission by sexual contact. Current recommendations about sexual practices are different for persons with chronic HCV infection who are in steady monogamous partnerships versus those with multiple partners or who are in short-term sexual relationships.},

The intracellular glucose concentration was 1.5 mM, much higher than in most earlier reports. We show that for the simplest model of a glucose carrier, this concentration is sufficient to reduce the glucose influx by 50\%. We conclude that intracellular glucose is the most likely candidate for the observed regulation of glucose import and hence glycolysis.

  abstract = {In parallel with rising mortality from drug overdoses, hospitalizations for infectious complications from substance use are increasing [1]. One in 9 hospitalized adults in the United States has a substance use disorder (SUD) [2]. Traditionally, patients with injection drug use (IDU)--associated infections such as infective endocarditis or osteomyelitis may be subjected to prolonged hospitalizations for intravenous (IV) antimicrobial treatment. Treating SUDs in hospitalized patients is now considered standard of care, though SUD care is still suboptimal in many hospitals [3, 4]. While hospitalizations can and should give patients the opportunity to engage in treatment for SUDs, some patients may prefer not to pursue SUD treatment options at that time or may lack SUD treatment options. A growing body of evidence supports inclusion of patient preferences in antimicrobial treatment decisions, considering multiple antimicrobial treatment options for effective treatment of hospitalized people with SUD [5--7], incorporating multidisciplinary management, and flattening barriers, such as stigma and distrust, that lead to delayed presentation and less favorable outcomes. We represent infectious diseases (ID) and addiction medicine clinicians, researchers, and a person who formerly used drugs/harm reduction outreach specialist who are sounding the alarm that increased attention is needed to support equitable interventions and improve patient outcomes and well-being.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY Fungal endocarditis accounts for 1\% to 3\% of all infective endocarditis cases, is associated with high morbidity and mortality ({$>$}70\%), and presents numerous challenges during clinical care. Candida spp. are the most common causes of fungal endocarditis, implicated in over 50\% of cases, followed by Aspergillus and Histoplasma spp. Important risk factors for fungal endocarditis include prosthetic valves, prior heart surgery, and injection drug use. The signs and symptoms of fungal endocarditis are nonspecific, and a high degree of clinical suspicion coupled with the judicious use of diagnostic tests is required for diagnosis. In addition to microbiological diagnostics (e.g., blood culture for Candida spp. or galactomannan testing and PCR for Aspergillus spp.), echocardiography remains critical for evaluation of potential infective endocarditis, although radionuclide imaging modalities such as 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography are increasingly being used. A multimodal treatment approach is necessary: surgery is usually required and should be accompanied by long-term systemic antifungal therapy, such as echinocandin therapy for Candida endocarditis or voriconazole therapy for Aspergillus endocarditis.},

Inmany scientific disciplines, the goal of researchers is not only estimating causal effects of a treatment but also understanding the process in which the treatment causally affects the outcome. Causal mediation analysis is fre- quently used to assess potential causal mechanisms. The mediation package implements a comprehensive suite of statistical tools for conducting such an analysis. The package is organized into two distinct approaches. Using the model-based approach, researchers can estimate causal mediation effects and conduct sensitivity analysis under the stan- dard research design. Furthermore, the design-based approach provides several analysis tools that are applicable under different experimental designs. This approach requires weaker assumptions than the model-based approach. Finally, we also implement a statis- tical method for dealing with multiple (causally dependent) mediators, which are often encountered in practice.},

  abstract = {Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia is associated with mortality of more than 20\%. Combining standard therapy with a {$\beta$}-lactam antibiotic has been associated with reduced mortality, although adequately powered randomized clinical trials of this intervention have not been conducted.To determine whether combining an antistaphylococcal {$\beta$}-lactam with standard therapy is more effective than standard therapy alone in patients with MRSA bacteremia.Open-label, randomized clinical trial conducted at 27 hospital sites in 4 countries from August 2015 to July 2018 among 352 hospitalized adults with MRSA bacteremia. Follow-up was complete on October 23, 2018.Participants were randomized to standard therapy (intravenous vancomycin or daptomycin) plus an antistaphylococcal {$\beta$}-lactam (intravenous flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, or cefazolin) (n\,=\,174) or standard therapy alone (n\,=\,178). Total duration of therapy was determined by treating clinicians and the {$\beta$}-lactam was administered for 7 days.The primary end point was a 90-day composite of mortality, persistent bacteremia at day 5, microbiological relapse, and microbiological treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included mortality at days 14, 42, and 90; persistent bacteremia at days 2 and 5; acute kidney injury (AKI); microbiological relapse; microbiological treatment failure; and duration of intravenous antibiotics.The data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the study prior to enrollment of 440 patients because of safety. Among 352 patients randomized (mean age, 62.2 [SD, 17.7] years; 121 women [34.4\%]), 345 (98\%) completed the trial. The primary end point was met by 59 (35\%) with combination therapy and 68 (39\%) with standard therapy (absolute difference, -4.2\%; 95\% CI, -14.3\% to 6.0\%). Seven of 9 prespecified secondary end points showed no significant difference. For the combination therapy vs standard therapy groups, all-cause 90-day mortality occurred in 35 (21\%) vs 28 (16\%) (difference, 4.5\%; 95\% CI, -3.7\% to 12.7\%); persistent bacteremia at day 5 was observed in 19 of 166 (11\%) vs 35 of 172 (20\%) (difference, -8.9\%; 95\% CI, -16.6\% to -1.2\%); and, excluding patients receiving dialysis at baseline, AKI occurred in 34 of 145 (23\%) vs 9 of 145 (6\%) (difference, 17.2\%; 95\% CI, 9.3\%-25.2\%).Among patients with MRSA bacteremia, addition of an antistaphylococcal {$\beta$}-lactam to standard antibiotic therapy with vancomycin or daptomycin did not result in significant improvement in the primary composite end point of mortality, persistent bacteremia, relapse, or treatment failure. Early trial termination for safety concerns and the possibility that the study was underpowered to detect clinically important differences in favor of the intervention should be considered when interpreting the findings.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02365493},

  abstract = {Chronic B and C virus hepatitis (HBV and HCV) are the most important risk factors in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). About 40-50\% of HCC is induced by these two chronic viral infections. Prevalence of HCC is slowly increasing in the United States and in Western-Europe, whereas alcohol consumption is gradually decreasing in the majority of these countries. However, the most important environmental risk factor for HCC is still the heavy long-term alcohol use. The risk of cirrhosis and HCC increases linearly, wherever ethanol intake is greater than 60 g/day for men and women. Aflatoxin, which contaminates grains, mostly in China and Africa, is a well-known mycotoxin. Since geographical distribution of aflatoxin as well as HBV overlaps with each other, they have a synergistic effect on inducing HCC. Cigarette smoking has also hepatocarcinogenic effect, which is significantly enhanced by the concomitant alcohol use or chronic viral hepatitis. Obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver and steatohepatitis as well as diabetes mellitus together also form a significant risk for HCC, due to the gradually increasing number of patients. Insulin resistance and oxidative stress are the major pathogenetic mechanisms leading to hepatic cell injury in these patients. Oral contraceptive drugs may also play a role in the development of HCC. The long-term exposure to organic solvents is also a risk factor for HCC. Dietary antioxidants, selenium, statins and coffee drinking have protective effect against HCC.},

Survey researchers have had similar concerns about the accuracy of survey reports about such topics as illicit drug use, abortion, and sexual behavior. The article reviews the research done by survey methodologists on reporting errors in surveys on sensitive topics, noting parallels and differences from the psychological literature on social desirability. The findings from the survey studies suggest that misreporting about sensitive topics is quite common and that it is largely situational. The extent of misreporting depends on whether the respondent has anything embarrassing to report and on design features of the survey. The survey evidence also indicates that misreporting on sensitive topics is a more or less motivated process in which respondents edit the information they report to avoid embarrassing themselves in the presence of an interviewer or to avoi},

We develop and evaluate an inference framework to jointly estimate the reproduction number and the dispersion parameter from the size distribution of clusters of identical sequences. We then illustrate its application across a range of epidemiological situations. Finally, we develop a hypothesis testing framework relying on clusters of identical sequences to determine whether a given pathogen genetic subpopulation is associated with increased or reduced transmissibility. Our work provides tools to estimate the reproduction number and transmission heterogeneity from pathogen sequences without building a phylogenetic tree, thus making it easily scalable to large pathogen genome datasets.},

METHODS: The gross pathologic types of HCC were assessed by ultrasonography combined, in most cases, with computed tomography and angiography. RESULTS: Solitary HCC was the most common cancer type (54.8\%), followed by the multinodular (31\%), diffuse (7.7\%), and massive (6.5\%) types. Cirrhosis and blood group other than O were independent risk factors for multinodular HCC (relative risk [RR] 1.6, P {$<$} 0.05; and RR 1.7, P {$<$} 0.005, respectively); the absence of cirrhosis and a heavy smoking habit were risk factors for the massive type (RR 4.9, P {$<$} 0.001; and RR 3.3, P {$<$} 0.01, respectively); and blood group O for the solitary type (RR 1.4, P {$<$} 0.001). The prevalence of highly undifferentiated cells increased as the tumor size did, so that grade IV cell atypia was associated with massive size of the carcinoma (P {$<$} 0.05). In cirrhotic patients, advanced liver dysfunction was associated with diffuse HCC (P {$<$} 0.05). As far as solitary HCC is concerned, the tumor size was greater in noncirrhotic than in cirrhotic patients (7 +/- 0.4 cm versus 4.8 +/- 0.15, P {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In Italian patients, HCC presents most frequently as a solitary nodule. The presence or absence of cirrhosis, blood group, and smoking habit can influence the likelihood of developing certain HCC shapes. The probability of harboring highly undifferentiated cells increases as the cancer increases in size. In cirrhosis, advanced liver dysfunction may predispose to diffuse HCC.},

  abstract = {Introduction Walking is a common form of physical activity and is the most frequent way to access public transit. On-going changes in the US transportation system are occurring, notably increases in smartphone application-based ridesharing. The goal of this research is to assess whether increasing use of ridesharing was associated with a change in transit-related walking. This is important to both public health and transportation, as it can inform changes in active transportation which promotes both physical activity and transit use. Methods We examined the association between change in transit use, transit-related walking, and ridesharing nationally and for selected metropolitan areas using the 2009 and 2017 National Household Travel Survey ({$\geq$}18 years; n~=~263,572 and n~=~230,592, respectively). Analyses were conducted in 2019. Covariates included sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, employment, work from home, household size, number of vehicles, population density, Census region, metro area size and heavy rail transit category and season. Results The national prevalence of transit use in the past month in 2009 was 16.9\% (95\% CI: 16.4\%--17.4\%) and in 2017 was 16.1\% (15.6\%--16.6\%), a significant decrease (p~{$<~$}0.02). The prevalence of daily transit-related walking in 2009 was 4.2\% (4.0\%--4.4\%) and in 2017 was 4.4\% (4.2\%--4.6\%; p~=~0.22). The prevalence of daily taxi use in 2009 was 0.5\% (0.4\%--0.6\%) and taxi/rideshare in 2017 was 1.1\% (1.0\%--1.2\%), a significant increase (p~{$<~$}0.0001). The relationships remained after covariate adjustment. Finally, there was not a significant change in transit-related walking or interaction between year and taxi/rideshare use after additional adjustment for taxi/rideshare. Changes in transit-related walking in metros were largely not significant, whereas increases in taxi/rideshare were largely significant. Conclusions Results suggest that increased use of ridesharing may not be linked with changes in transit-related walking. Continued surveillance of travel mode prevalence is required to track potential reductions in population-level physical activity with technology-related changes in travel.},

The present study reports the prevalence by age and gender of common chronic pain conditions (headache, back or neck pain, arthritis or joint pain, and other chronic pain) in 10 developed and 7 developing countries and their association with the spectrum of both depressive and anxiety disorders. It draws on data from 18 general adult population surveys using a common survey questionnaire (N = 42,249). Results show that age-standardized prevalence of chronic pain conditions in the previous 12 months was 37.3\% in developed countries and 41.1\% in developing countries, with back pain and headache being somewhat more common in developing than developed countries. After controlling for comorbid chronic physical diseases, several findings were consistent across developing and developed countries. There was a higher prevalence of chronic pain conditions among females and older persons; and chronic pain was similarly associated with depression-anxiety spectrum disorders in developed and developing countries. However, the large majority of persons reporting chronic pain did not meet criteria for depression or anxiety disorder. We conclude that common pain conditions affect a large percentage of persons in both developed and developing countries. Perspective: Chronic pain conditions are common in both developed and developing countries. Overall, the prevalence of pain is greater among females and among older persons. Although most persons reporting pain do not meet criteria for a depressive or anxiety disorder, depression/anxiety spectrum disorders are associated with pain in both developed and developing countries. \copyright{} 2008 American Pain Society.},

We find that six of the eight largest English Omicron lineages were already transmitting when Omicron was first reported in southern Africa (22 November 2021). Multiple datasets show that importation of Omicron continued despite subsequent restrictions on travel from southern Africa as a result of export from well-connected secondary locations. Initiation and dispersal of Omicron transmission lineages in England was a two-stage process that can be explained by models of the country's human geography and hierarchical travel network. Our results enable a comparison of the processes that drive the invasion of Omicron and other VOCs across multiple spatial scales.},

HRSN items included food insecurity, transportation barriers, utility needs, interpersonal violence, housing instability, immigration history, and neighborhood perceptions on cohesion and trust. We conducted medical chart reviews for a subset of participants to explore the relationship between HRSN and history of cancer screening. Results: Among 236 participants, most were Asian (74\%), non-US born (79\%), and privately insured (57\%). One-third responded in Chinese (37\%). Half reported having {$\geq$}1 HRSN. Interpersonal violence was high across all participants. Transportation needs were highest among Chinese-T participants, while food insecurity and housing instability were highest among Chinese-S participants. Lower-income patients had higher odds of having {$\geq$}2 HRSN (OR:2.53, 95\% CI: 1.12, 5.98). Older age and public insurance/uninsured were significantly associated with low neighborhood perceptions. Conclusions: We observed higher than anticipated reports of HRSN among primary care patients in a suburban, hospital-affiliated practice serving AA. Low neighborhood perceptions, particularly among Chinese-S participants, highlight the importance of addressing broader SDOH among insured, suburban AA patients.},

Recent studies show that African-Caribbean women who have a high level of internalized racism (INR) are at increased risk for abdominal obesity and glucose intolerance. The aim of the current study was to determine if African-Caribbean women with high and low INR differ in their levels of perceived stress and defeat coping style, and in the relationship of these factors to cortisol secretion.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: On the island of Dominica, information on perceived stress and coping style was collected from age- and body mass index-matched samples of nondiabetic women aged 25-60 with high (n = 27) and low (n = 26) INR. Cortisol levels for each participant were determined from saliva specimens collected at 8:30 am and 10:30 pm.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: A higher mean perceived stress score (PSS) and greater tendency to use "restraint," "denial" and "behavioral disengagement" (defeated) coping (BDC) styles were found among women with high INR compared to those with low INR. In the combined sample, PSS and BDC were significantly correlated with an indicator of dysregulation of cortisol. However, in group-specific analyses, adjusting for age and education, these correlations remained significant only among women with high INR.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: These findings support the view that high perceived stress and defeated coping style may be factors that link high INR to dysregulation of cortisol and, perhaps, also to greater risk of metabolic abnormalities.},

  abstract = {As the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads through human populations, the unprecedented accumulation of viral genome sequences is ushering in a new era of `genomic contact tracing'---that is, using viral genomes to trace local transmission dynamics. However, because the viral phylogeny is already so large---and will undoubtedly grow many fold---placing new sequences onto the tree has emerged as a barrier to real-time genomic contact tracing. Here, we resolve this challenge by building an efficient tree-based data structure encoding the inferred evolutionary history of the virus. We demonstrate that our approach greatly improves the speed of phylogenetic placement of new samples and data visualization, making it possible to complete the placements under the constraints of real-time contact tracing. Thus, our method addresses an important need for maintaining a fully updated reference phylogeny. We make these tools available to the research community through the University of California Santa Cruz SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser to enable rapid cross-referencing of information in new virus sequences with an ever-expanding array of molecular and structural biology data. The methods described here will empower research and genomic contact tracing for SARS-CoV-2 specifically for laboratories worldwide.},

  abstract = {Despite several studies support a positive association between heavy alcohol consumption and liver cancer risk, a consistent dose-risk relationship has not yet been established. We carried out a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the association between alcohol intake and liver cancer occurrence, following the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. We searched for cohort and nested case-control studies on the general population published before April 2013, using PubMed and EMBASE. Summary meta-analytic relative risks (RRs) were estimated using random-effect models. We included 16 articles (19 cohorts) for a total of 4445 incident cases and 5550 deaths from liver cancer. Compared with non-drinking, the pooled RRs were 0.91 (95\% confidence interval, CI, 0.81-1.02) for moderate drinking ({$<$}3 drinks per day) and 1.16 (95\% CI, 1.01-1.34) for heavy drinking ({$<$}3 drinks per day), with significant heterogeneity among studies. The dose-risk curve suggested a linear relationship with increasing alcohol intake in drinkers, with estimated excess risk of 46\% for 50 g of ethanol per day and 66\% for 100 g per day. This systematic review suggests a moderate detrimental role of consumption of 3 or more alcoholic drinks per day on liver cancer, and a lack of association with moderate drinking. Our results have to be taken with due caution on account of the possible limitations of the original studies included in the meta-analysis. \copyright{} The Author 2014.

This notice also provides a summary of comments received in response to proposed criteria published in the August 24, 2010, Federal Register (75 FR 52174), as well as the Census Bureau's response to those comments. The Census Bureau's urban-rural classification is fundamentally a delineation of geographic areas, identifying both individual urban areas and the rural areas of the nation. The Census Bureau's urban areas represent densely developed territory, and encompass residential, commercial, and other nonresidential urban land uses. The Census Bureau delineates urban areas after each decennial census by applying specified criteria to decennial census and other data. Since the 1950 Census, the Census Bureau has reviewed and revised these criteria, as necessary, for each decennial census. The revisions over the years reflect the Census Bureau's desire to improve the classification of urban and rural territory to take advantage of newly available data, as well as advancements in geographic information processing technology.},

  abstract = {Infection is a major cause of death in patients with aplastic anemia (AA). There are differences between the immunocompromised state of a patient with AA and the patient who is neutropenic due to chemotherapy and this leads to a difference in the infections that they incur. Prolonged neutropenia is one of the largest risk factors for the development of infections with the invasive mycoses and bacteria. Recovery from neutropenia is directly related to survival, and supportive care plays a large role in protection while the patient is in a neutropenic state. The most common invasive mycoses include the Aspergillus species, Zygomycetes, Candida spp., and Fusarium spp. Bacterial infections that are seen in patients with AA include gram-positive coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, Enterococcus, Staphylococus aureus, Clostridium spp., Micrococcus, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus cereus. Gram-negative infections including gram-negative bacilli, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Bacteroides fragilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumonia, Aeromonas hydrophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio vulnificus. Viral infections are much less common but include those that belong to the Herpesviridae family, community-acquired respiratory viral infection, and the viral hepatitides A, B, and C. Evidence of the parasite Strongyloides stercoralis has also been documented. This review discusses the major invasive fungal infections, bacterial pathogens, parasites, and viral infections that are found in patients with AA who are treated with immunosuppressive therapy. The specific immune impairment and current treatment parameters for each of these classes of infection will also be discussed.},

  abstract = {Viral phylodynamics is defined as the study of how epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes act and potentially interact to shape viral phylogenies. Since the coining of the term in 2004, research on viral phylodynamics has focused on transmission dynamics in an effort to shed light on how these dynamics impact viral genetic variation. Transmission dynamics can be considered at the level of cells within an infected host, individual hosts within a population, or entire populations of hosts. Many viruses, especially RNA viruses, rapidly accumulate genetic variation because of short generation times and high mutation rates. Patterns of viral genetic variation are therefore heavily influenced by how quickly transmission occurs and by which entities transmit to one another. Patterns of viral genetic variation will also be affected by selection acting on viral phenotypes. Although viruses can differ with respect to many phenotypes, phylodynamic studies have to date tended to focus on a limited number of viral phenotypes. These include virulence phenotypes, phenotypes associated with viral transmissibility, cell or tissue tropism phenotypes, and antigenic phenotypes that can facilitate escape from host immunity. Due to the impact that transmission dynamics and selection can have on viral genetic variation, viral phylogenies can therefore be used to investigate important epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes, such as epidemic spread [2], spatio-temporal dynamics including metapopulation dynamics [3], zoonotic transmission, tissue tropism [4], and antigenic drift [5]. The quantitative investigation of these processes through the consideration of viral phylogenies is the central aim of viral phylodynamics.},

The clinical evidence of benefit of coffee consumption in Hepatitis B and C, as well as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, has also been presented. Coffee consumption is associated with improvement in liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and GGTP), especially in individuals with risk for liver disease. Coffee intake more than 2 cups per day in patients with preexisting liver disease has been shown to be associated with lower incidence of fibrosis and cirrhosis, lower hepatocellular carcinoma rates, as well as decreased mortality.},

  abstract = {Viral hepatitides are important public health problems in humans. The etiologic agents were not identified until 1965, when Baruch S. Blumberg found the relationship of Australia antigen to serum hepatitis. The antigen was found to be the surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). This observation launched a new era in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of hepatitis B. Over 15-20 years, the natural history of HBV infection was elucidated, and more importantly, an effective vaccine became available. The routes of transmission were also made clear, rendering effective interruption of the transmission possible. The vaccine together with effective interruption of the transmission contributed greatly to the control of HBV infection. However, these measures do very little for those who have already been chronically infected. Fortunately, specific therapies against chronic hepatitis B started to appear about 10-15 years before, and the treatments have improved substantially in the last few years. Although far from perfect, effective means to treat those who are chronically infected now exist. In Taiwan, acute and chronic liver diseases were rampant as early as the beginning of the last century. Studies around 1975, showed an extremely high prevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection in the general population (15-20\%), and 80-90\% of the chronic liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma were caused by chronic infection with the HBV. This important health problem caught the attention of the government in the late 1970s, and a government-sponsored control program was finalized in 1981. Accordingly, a mass vaccination program against hepatitis B, primarily aiming at immunizing newborn infants, was launched on July 1, 1984. Twenty years after implementation of the program, the hepatitis B carrier rate in children covered by the program decreased by 85\%, from {$\sim$} 15\% to {$<$}1\%. Most importantly, the deadly sequela of hepatocellular carcinoma in the vaccinees was also found to decrease in parallel. This is the first time that a human cancer was prevented by vaccination. Despite the success, there are still some who were born after implementation of the program but were not prevented from developing chronic hepatitis B infection and hepatocellular carcinoma. Non-compliance to the vaccination schedule, breakthrough infection and intrauterine infection are the causes of the failure. At present, we have effective measures for immunizing susceptible individuals, interrupting the routes of transmission and treating the chronically infected. The time for considering the elimination or even the eradication of HBV infection has come. This is especially true for countries where hepatitis B infection is not endemic. Nevertheless, with the admirable results achieved in the past, Taiwan should also think about elimination/eradication of hepatitis B, even though it will certainly be much more difficult than in the non-endemic countries. In exploring the possibility of eliminating/eradicating hepatitis B in Taiwan, we reviewed the epidemiology of hepatitis B, and analyzed the problems that remain to be tackled in Taiwan. We hope that Taiwan can take further steps towards the elimination or eradication of hepatitis B. \copyright{} 2011, Elsevier Taiwan LLC. All rights reserved.},

In the case of lattice (regional summary) data, two common autoregressive models used are the conditional autoregressive model (CAR) and the simultaneously autoregressive model (SAR). Both of these models produce spatial dependence in the covariance structure as a function of a neighbor matrix W and often a fixed unknown spatial correlation parameter. This paper examines in detail the correlation structures implied by these models as applied to an irregular lattice in an attempt to demonstrate their many counterintuitive or impractical results. A data example is used for illustration where US statewide average SAT verbal scores are modeled and examined for spatial structure using different spatial models. \copyright{} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

We conclude that the transporter or group of transporters is constitutive and that regulation of glucose transport occurs via a factor that modifies the affinity of the transporters and not via the synthesis of different kinetically independent transporters.

Formed in 1964, the ACIP was charged with this role. The committee has undergone significant changes in structure and operational activities during its 50-year history. The ACIP works closely with many liaison organizations to develop its immunization recommendations, which are harmonized among key professional medical societies. ACIP vaccine recommendations form two immunization schedules, which are updated annually: (1) the childhood and adolescent immunization schedule and (2) the adult immunization schedule. Today, once ACIP recommendations are adopted by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, these recommendations are published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), become official policy, and are incorporated into the appropriate immunization schedule.},

  abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been one of the most fatal malignant tumors worldwide and its associated morbidity and mortality remain of significant concern. Based on in-depth reviews of serological diagnosis of HCC, in addition to AFP, there are other biomarkers: Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive AFP (AFP-L3), des- carboxyprothrombin (DCP), tyrosine kinase with Ig and eprdermal growth factor (EGF) homology domains 2 (TIE2)-espressing monocytes (TEMs), glypican-3 (GPC3), Golgi protein 73 (GP73), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) have been proposed as biomarkers for the early detection of HCC. The diagnosis of HCC is primarily based on noninvasive standard imaging methods, such as ultrasound (US), dynamic multiphasic multidetector-row CT (MDCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Some experts advocate gadolinium diethyl-enetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) MRI and contrast-enhanced US as the promising imaging madalities of choice. With regard to recent advancements in tissue markers, many cuting-edge technologies using genome-wide DNA microarrays, qRT-PCR, and proteomic and inmunostaining studies have been implemented in an attempt to identify markers for early diagnosis of HCC. Only less than half of HCC patients at initial diagnosis are at an early stage treatable with curative options: local ablation, surgical resection, or liver transplant. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is considered the standard of care with palliation for intermediate stage HCC. Recent innovative procedures using drug-eluting-beads and radioembolization using Yttrium-90 may exhibit beneficial effects in HCC treatment. During the past few years, several molecular targeted agents have been evaluated in clinical trials in advanced HCC. Sorafenib is currently the only approved systemic treatment for HCC. It has been approved for the therapy of asymptomatic HCC patients with well-preserved liver function who are not candidates for potentially curative treatments, such as surgical resection or liver transplantation. In the USA, Europe and particularly Japan, hepatitis C virus (HCV) related HCC accounts for most liver cancer, as compared with Asia-Pacific regions, where hepatitis B virus (HBV) may play a more important role in HCC development. HBV vaccination, while a vaccine is not yet available against HCV, has been recognized as a best primary prevention method for HBV-related HCC, although in patients already infected with HBV or HCV, secondary prevention with antiviral therapy is still a reasonable strategy. In addition to HBV and HCV, attention should be paid to other relevant HCC risk factors, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease due to obesity and diabetes, heavy alcohol consumption, and prolonged aflatoxin exposure. Interestingly, coffee and vitamin K2 have been proven to provide protective effects against HCC. Regarding tertiary prevention of HCC recurrence after surgical resection, addition of antiviral treatment has proven to be a rational strategy.},

In this paper, based on the genome-scale Escherichia coli stoichiometric model iJR904, through the GAMS linear programming package, the in silico maximal succinate yield was estimated to be 1.714 mol/mol glucose. When another two constraints were added, the maximal succinate yield dropped to 1.60 mol/mol glucose. Further analysis substantiated the uniqueness of the flux distribution under such constraints. After comparisons with the metabolic flux analysis (MFA) results computed from the wet experimental data of the three kinds of E. coli, three potential improvement target sites, the glucose phosphotransferase transport system, the pyruvate carboxylase, and the glyoxylate shunt, were identified and selected for the genetic modifications. All the three genetic modified strains showed increased succinate yield. The final strain TUQ19/pQZ6 had a high yield of 1.29 mol succinate/mol glucose and high productivity. The success of the above experiments proved that this in silico optimal succinate production pathway is reasonable and practical. This method may also be used as a general strategy to help enhance the yields of other favorable metabolites in E. coli.},

The model specification allows for region-specific heterogeneity, correlation across response types, and spatial autocorrelation via a Poisson-based multivariate conditional auto-regressive (CAR) framework and is estimated using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Least-squares regression estimates of walk-miles traveled per zone serve as the exposure measure. Here, the Poisson-lognormal multivariate CAR model outperforms an aspatial Poisson-lognormal multivariate model and a spatial model (without cross-severity correlation), both in terms of fit and inference. Positive spatial autocorrelation emerges across neighborhoods, as expected (due to latent heterogeneity or missing variables that trend in space, resulting in spatial clustering of crash counts). In comparison, the positive aspatial, bivariate cross correlation of severe (fatal or incapacitating) and non-severe crash rates reflects latent covariates that have impacts across severity levels but are more local in nature (such as lighting conditions and local sight obstructions), along with spatially lagged cross correlation. Results also suggest greater mixing of residences and commercial land uses is associated with higher pedestrian crash risk across different severity levels, ceteris paribus, presumably since such access produces more potential conflicts between pedestrian and vehicle movements. Interestingly, network densities show variable effects, and sidewalk provision is associated with lower severe-crash rates. \copyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Differences in cancer survival account for part of this disparity. Among both men and women, five-year survival for all cancers combined is 10 percentage points lower among persons who live in poorer than in more affluent census tracts. Even when census tract poverty rate is accounted for, however, African American, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and Asian/Pacific Islander men and African American and American Indian/Alaskan Native women have lower five-year survival than non-Hispanic Whites. More detailed analyses of selected cancers show large variations in cancer survival by race and ethnicity.

  abstract = {Background. Our objective was to assess trends in the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the United States after widespread hepatitis B vaccination. Methods. The prevalence of HBV infection and immunity was determined in a representative sample of the US population for the periods 1999--2006 and 1988--1994. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys participants ?6 years of age were tested for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs). Prevalence estimates were weighted and age-adjusted. Results. During the period 1999--2006, age-adjusted prevalences of anti-HBc (4.7\%) and HBsAg (0.27\%) were not statistically different from what they were during 1988--1994 (5.4\% and 0.38\%, respectively). The prevalence of anti-HBc decreased among persons 6--19 years of age (from 1.9\% to 0.6\%; P ! .01) and 20--49 years of age (from 5.9\% to 4.6\%; P ! .05) but not among persons ?50 years of age (7.2\% vs 7.7\%). During 1999--2006, the prevalence of anti-HBc was higher among non-Hispanic blacks (12.2\%) and persons of ``Other'' race (13.3\%) than it was among non-Hispanic whites (2.8\%) or Mexican Americans (2.9\%), and it was higher among foreign-born participants (12.2\%) than it was among US-born participants (3.5\%). Prevalence among US-born children 6--19 years of age (0.5\%) did not differ by race or ethnicity. Disparities between US-born and foreign-born children were smaller during 1999--1996 (0.5\% vs 2.0\%) than during 1988--1994 (1.0\% vs 12.8\%). Among children 6--19 years of age, 56.7\% had markers of vaccine-induced immunity. Conclusions. HBV prevalence decreased among US children, which reflected the impact of global and domestic vaccination, but it changed little among adults, and {$\sim$}730,000 US residents (95\% confidence interval, 550,000-- 940,000) are chronically infected.},

  abstract = {Many community decision-making bodies encounter challenges in creating conditions where stakeholders from disadvantaged populations can authentically participate in ways that give them actual influence over decisions affecting their lives (Foster-Fishman et al., Lessons for the journey: Strategies and suggestions for guiding planning, governance, and sustainability in comprehensive community initiatives. W.K. Kellogg Foundation, Battle Creek, MI, 2004). These challenges are often rooted in asymmetrical power dynamics operating within the settings (Prilleltensky, J Commun Psychol 36:116-136, 2008). In response, this paper presents the Exchange Boundary Framework, a new approach for understanding and promoting authentic, empowered participation within collaborative decision-making settings. The framework expands upon theories currently used in the field of community psychology by focusing on the underlying processes through which power operates in relationships and examining the evolution of power dynamics over time. By integrating concepts from social exchange theory (Emerson, Am Soc Rev 27:31-41, 1962) and social boundaries theory (Hayward, Polity 31(1):1-22, 1998), the framework situates power within parallel processes of resources exchange and social regulation. The framework can be used to understand the conditions leading to power asymmetries within collaborative decisionmaking processes, and guide efforts to promote more equitable and authentic participation by all stakeholders within these settings. In this paper we describe the Exchange Boundary Framework, apply it to three distinct case studies, and discuss key considerations for its application within collaborative community settings.},

We examine the nature and source of these social responsibilities, discuss a debate in the epidemiological literature on roles and responsibilities, and cite approaches to environmental justice as reflective of them. At one level, responsibility refers to accountability, as in being responsible for actions taken. A deeper meaning of responsibility corresponds to commitment to the pursuit and achievement of a valued end. Epidemiologists are committed to the scientific study of health and disease in human populations and to the application of scientific knowledge to improve the public's health. Responsibility is also closely linked to reliability. Responsible professionals reliably perform the tasks they set for themselves as well as the tasks society expects them to undertake. The defining axiom for our approach is that the health of the public is a social good we commit ourselves to pursue, thus assuming an obligation to contribute to its achievement. Epidemiologists cannot claim to be committed to public health as a social good and not accept the responsibility of ensuring that the knowledge gained in their roles as scientists is used to achieve that good. The social responsibilities of environmental health researchers are conspicuous in the environmental justice movement, for example, in community-based participatory research. Responsibility is an ethical concept particularly well suited to frame many key aspects of the ethics of our profession.},

Among refusers, we studied their socioeconomic characteristics and health care utilization patterns. Methods: Medical records were reviewed to validate refusal status in the immunization registries of two health plans. Racial, education, and income characteristics of children claiming refusal were collected based on the census tract of each child. Health care utilization was identified using both electronic medical record and insurance claims. Within the immunization registries of two HMOs in the study, some providers use refusal and medical contraindication interchangeably, and some providers tend to always use "ever refusal." Therefore, we combined medical contraindication and refusal together and treated them all as "refusal" in this study. Results: The immunization registry, compared to chart review, had negative predictive values of 85--92\% and 90--97\% for 2- and 6-year olds, and positive predictive values of only 52--74\% and 59--62\% to identify vaccine refusals. Refusers were more likely to reside in well-educated, higher income areas than non-refusers. Refusers had not opted out of health care system and continued, although less frequently for the age 2 and under group, to use services. Conclusion: Without enhancements to immunization registries, identifying children with immunization refusal would be time consuming. Since communities where refusers live are well educated, interventions should target these communities to communicate vaccine adverse events and consequences of vaccine preventable diseases.},

Less than one quarter of women and heterosexual men had 2 or more sexual partners, whereas 59\% of MSM reported having multiple partners. Most unprotected vaginal and anal sexual activity took place in the context of relationships with other HIV-positive individuals. Approximately 19\% of women, 15.6\% of MSM, and 13.1\% of heterosexual men engaged in unprotected vaginal or anal intercourse with partners who were HIV-negative or whose serostatus was unknown. The majority of sexually active participants disclosed their serostatus to all partners with whom they engaged in unprotected intercourse. An estimated 30.4 new infections (79.7\% as a result of sexual interactions with MSM) would be expected among the sex partners of study participants during the 3-month reporting period. Eighteen percent of 304 participants who injected drugs in the past 3 months reported lending their used injection equipment to others. In addition to the more traditional approaches of HIV test counseling and of focusing on persons not infected, intensive prevention programs for persons with HIV infection are needed to stem the future spread of the virus.},

  abstract = {Abstract Many survival studies record the times to two or more distinct failures on each subject. The failures may be events of different natures or may be repetitions of the same kind of event. In this article, we consider the regression analysis of such multivariate failure time observations. Each marginal distribution of the failure times is formulated by a Cox proportional hazards model. No specific structure of dependence among the distinct failure times on each subject is imposed. The regression parameters in the Cox models are estimated by maximizing the failure-specific partial likelihoods. The resulting estimators are shown to be asymptotically jointly normal with a covariance matrix that can be consistently estimated. Simultaneous inferential procedures are then proposed. Extensive Monte Carlo studies indicate that the normal approximation is adequate for practical use. The new methods allow time-dependent covariates, missing observations, and arbitrary patterns of censorship. They are illustrated with two real-life examples. For recurrent failure time data, various regression methods have been proposed in the literature. These methods, however, generally assume stringent structures of dependence among the recurrences of each subject. Moreover, as shown in the present article, they are rather sensitive to model misspecification.},

However, we have a limited understanding of how the antigenic effects of viral mutations vary across the human population, and how this heterogeneity affects virus evolution. Here we use deep mutational scanning to map how mutations to the hemagglutinin (HA) proteins of the A/Hong Kong/45/2019 (H3N2) and A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) strains affect neutralization by serum from individuals of a variety of ages. The effects of HA mutations on serum neutralization differ across age groups in ways that can be partially rationalized in terms of exposure histories. Mutations that fixed in influenza variants after 2020 cause the greatest escape from sera from younger individuals. Overall, these results demonstrate that influenza faces distinct antigenic selection regimes from different age groups, and suggest approaches to understand how this heterogeneous selection shapes viral evolution.},

SETTING: United States and worldwide, February to April 2007. PATIENTS: 143 patients with epilepsy. INTERVENTION: A 22-item survey was developed to ask patients with epilepsy or their caregivers about the impact of limited transportation on adherence with medications. The survey was placed on Zoomerang.com. An invitation to participate in the survey was sent via e-mail to members of the Epilepsy.com website, and an invitation with a link to the survey was placed on Epilepsy.com. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Whether patients with epilepsy have difficulty picking up prescriptions on time because of transportation problems and whether they felt they would miss fewer doses if transportation was not an issue. RESULTS: 143 individuals with epilepsy completed part or all of the survey. Of patients who were unable to drive, 45\% reported that fewer doses would be missed if transportation was not a problem. Patients who were unable to drive had an odds ratio of 4.2 (P {$<$} 0.0001) of being unable to get medications on time. No differences were observed in the number of patients missing prescription medications associated with availability of insurance, use of mail service pharmacies, or population size of patients' area of residence. Ability to drive and distance to the pharmacy were the only factors associated with nonadherence. CONCLUSION: Limited transportation may be a factor in poor medication adherence in patients with epilepsy.},

METHODS: We used data from the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a prospective longitudinal study of 1829 youths randomly sampled from detention in Chicago, Illinois, starting in 1995 and reinterviewed up to 9 times in the community or correctional facilities through 2011. Independent interviewers assessed SUDs with Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children 2.3 (baseline) and Diagnostic Interview Schedule version IV (follow-ups). RESULTS: By median age 28 years, 91.3\% of males and 78.5\% of females had ever had an SUD. At most follow-ups, males had greater odds of alcohol- and marijuana-use disorders. Drug-use disorders were most prevalent among non-Hispanic Whites, followed by Hispanics, then African Americans (e.g., compared with African Americans, non-Hispanic Whites had 32.1 times the odds of cocaine-use disorder [95\% confidence interval = 13.8, 74.7]). CONCLUSIONS: After detention, SUDs differed markedly by sex, race/ethnicity, and substance abused, and, contrary to stereotypes, did not disproportionately affect African Americans. Services to treat substance abuse-during incarceration and after release-would reach many people in need, and address health disparities in a highly vulnerable population.},

This ability to direct the assembly of nanoscale components into controlled and sophisticated structures has motivated intense efforts to develop assembly methods that mimic or exploit the recognition capabilities and interactions found in biological systems. Of particular value would be methods that could be applied to materials with interesting electronic or optical properties, but natural evolution has not selected for interactions between biomolecules and such materials. However, peptides with limited selectivity for binding to metal surfaces and metal oxide surfaces have been successfully selected. Here we extend this approach and show that combinatorial phage-display libraries can be used to evolve peptides that bind to a range of semiconductor surfaces with high specificity, depending on the crystallographic orientation and composition of the structurally similar materials we have used. As electronic devices contain structurally related materials in close proximity, such peptides may find use for the controlled placement and assembly of a variety of practically important materials, thus broadening the scope for 'bottom-up' fabrication approaches.},

METHOD: The distribution of Aotearoa's population was mapped, and the enhanced two-step floating catchment method (E2SFCA) applied to estimate spatial access to vaccination services. The Gini coefficient and spatial autocorrelation measures assessed the spatial equity of vaccination services. Additional statistics included an analysis of spatial accessibility for priority populations, and by District Health Board (DHB) region. RESULTS: Spatial accessibility to vaccination services varies across Aotearoa, and appears to be better in major cities than rural regions. A Gini coefficient of 0.426 confirms that spatial accessibility scores are not shared equally across the vaccine-eligible population. Furthermore, priority populations including M\=aori, Pasifika, and older people have statistically significantly lower spatial access to vaccination services. This is also true for people living in rural areas. Spatial access to vaccination services also varies significantly by DHB region as does the Gini coefficient, and the proportion of DHB priority population groups living in areas with poor access to vaccination services. A strong and significant positive correlation was identified between average spatial accessibility and the M\=aori vaccination rate ratio of DHBs. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccination services in Aotearoa are not equitably distributed. Priority populations, with the most pressing need to receive COVID-19 vaccinations, have the worst access to vaccination services.},

Methods: Using cross-sectional data from the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a national state-based, random sample telephone survey, we explored differences in self-rated health, obesity and selected behaviors (physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, fruit, and vegetable consumption) among females aged 18 years and older, who reported a previous breast cancer diagnosis (survivors, n = 10,035) and those who reported no breast cancer history (n = 234,375) by race/ethnicity. Adjusted prevalences of health status and behaviors, accounting for sociodemographics, comorbidities and health care access, were estimated by race/ethnicity. Results: Compared to all other racial/ethnic groups, more white females reported heavy alcohol consumption and more black females reported obesity regardless of their breast cancer status. Among breast cancer survivors, more whites (33.7 \%) were former smokers compared to blacks (24.5 \%), ``others'' (20.5 \%), and Hispanics (16.2 \%) (p = 0.001). Racial/ethnic differences in obesity also varied by reported time since diagnosis (p value = 0.018). Among long-term survivors (diagnosed {$\geq$}5 years before interview), more black survivors (34.8 \%) reported obesity compared to white survivors (23.0 \%). Also, among ``other'' race survivors, long-term survivors (22.0 \%) reported more obesity than survivors diagnosed less than 5 years before interview (7.8 \%). Conclusions: These findings suggest opportunities to increase health behaviors and reduce racial disparities among breast cancer survivors. Implications for Cancer Survivors: Engaging in healthy behaviors can play a significant role in enhancing health outcomes and quality of life of breast cancer survivors. More research is needed to better understand racial differences in obesity, smoking and alcohol consumption in order to develop effective, culturally appropriate interventions to promote a healthy lifestyle after a breast cancer diagnosis.

Recent studies have suggested that this racial disparity might be even greater in Chicago than the country as a whole. When data describing this racial disparity are presented they are sometimes attributed in part to racial differences in tumor biology. Vital records data were employed to calculate age-adjusted breast cancer mortality rates for women in Chicago, New York City and the United States from 1980-2005. Race-specific rate ratios were used to measure the disparity in breast cancer mortality. Breast cancer mortality rates by race are the main outcome. In all three geographies the rate ratios were approximately equal in 1980 and stayed that way until the early 1990s, when the white rates started to decline while the black rates remained rather constant. By 2005 the black:white rate ratio was 1.36 in NYC, 1.38 in the US, and 1.98 in Chicago. In any number of ways these data are inconsistent with the notion that the disparity in black:white breast cancer mortality rates is a function of differential biology. Three societal hypotheses are posited that may explain this disparity. All three are actionable, beginning today.},

Many case studies have been published which describe one or a small number of long-term infected individuals but no study has combined these sequences into a cohesive dataset. This work aims to rectify this and study the genomics of this patient group through a combination of literature searches as well as identifying new case series directly from the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) dataset. The spike gene receptor-binding domain and N-terminal domain (NTD) were identified as mutation hotspots. Numerous mutations associated with variants of concern were observed to emerge recurrently. Additionally a mutation in the envelope gene, T30I was determined to be the second most frequent recurrently occurring mutation arising in persistent infections. A high proportion of recurrent mutations in immunodeficient individuals are associated with ACE2 affinity, immune escape, or viral packaging optimisation.There is an apparent selective pressure for mutations that aid cell--cell transmission within the host or persistence which are often different from mutations that aid inter-host transmission, although the fact that multiple recurrent de novo mutations are considered defining for variants of concern strongly indicates that this potential source of novel variants should not be discounted.},

Extracellular calcium concentrations were varied between 2.5 and 11.0 mM. Maximal inotropic effects occurred between 5 and 8.0 mM calcium and further elevation to 11.0 mM was without additional influence. The effect of hyperosmotic sucrose and mannitol on papillary muscle performance was compared with that of 10(-6) M norepinephrine at calcium concentrations of 2.5 and 10.0 mM and with paired electrical stimulation in 10.0 mM calcium. Both norepinephrine and the hyperosmotic agents produced significant increases in developed tension and in the maximal rate of tension rise (dT/dt) in Krebs-Ringer in 2.5 and 4.0 mM calcium. In 10 mM calcium norepinephrine increased developed tension and dT/dt, but sucrose and mannitol caused no change or small reductions in both. Paired electrical stimulation, like hyperosmolality, caused no increase in dT/dt in 10 mM calcium. The presence of a potent pharmacological inhibitor of systolic calcium transfer across the cell membrane (D600, 10(-6) M) reduced developed tension and dT/dt by 76+/-2.7 and 74+/-2.0\%, respectively, and prevented and in fact reversed the expected increase in dT/dt associated with an increase in rate of stimulation (treppe). However, hypertonic mannitol and paired pacing persisted in causing marked increases in developed tension and dT/dt even in the presence of D600, suggesting that their inotropic effects are not dependent on increased intracellular transfer of calcium during systole through cell membrane channels in which D600 acts as a competitive inhibitor. The results of these studies suggest that apparent functional saturation of intracellular calcium receptor sites eliminates any additional inotropic effect of hyperosmolality or paired pacing. The data are compatible with the hypothesis that the inotropic effects of hyperosmolality and of paired pacing result from an increase in calcium concentration at the myofilaments during contraction. The increase induced by hyperosmolality might occur because of an increase in the total amount of calcium released into the cytosol with each action potential and/or as a passive consequence of cellular dehydration. Norepinephrine has the capacity to increase contractility even when intracellular calcium receptor sites appear to be functionally saturated, suggesting that it may act at least in part by a mechanism that is independent of changes in net intracellular calcium concentration.},

The authors review evidence that suggests that segregation is a primary cause of racial differences in socioeconomic status (SES) by determining access to education and employment opportunities. SES in turn remains a fundamental cause of racial differences in health. Segregation also creates conditions inimical to health in the social and physical environment.

There was scant media attention to the problem of concen-trated urban poverty (neighborhoods in which a high percentage of the resi-dents fall beneath the federally designated poverty line), little or no discussion of inner-city challenges by mainstream political leaders, and even an apparent quiescence on the part of ghetto residents themselves. This was dramatically different from the 1960s, when the transition from legal segregation to a more racially open society was punctuated by social unrest that sometimes expressed itself in violent terms, as seen in the riots that followed the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. But in 2005, Hurricane Katrina exposed concentrated poverty in New Orleans. When television cameras focused on the flooding, the people trapped in houses and apartments, and the vast devastation, many Americans were shocked to see the squalid living conditions of the poor. Of course, the devas-tation of Katrina was broadly visited upon the residents of New Orleans, black and white, rich and poor, property owner and public housing tenant alike. But while many residents were able to flee, the very poor, lacking auto-mobiles or money for transportation and lodging, stayed to wait out the storm with tragic results. And through Katrina, the nation's attention became riveted on these poor urban neighborhoods. Some people argued that Katrina demonstrated how foolhardy is reli-ance on the government for protection, rather than self-reliance and control of one's own fate. However, it is unfair and indeed unwarranted to blame people with limited resources for being trapped in their neighborhoods and},

  abstract = {The term "race" has many definitions, ranging from a family unit to a species, but in common and medical usage, defining "race" has meant separating Homo sapiens into three to six groups. This division of Homo sapiens into race taxons started in the 18th century, when the sciences of genetics and evolutionary biology were not yet invented. These disciplines have since shown that human race taxonomy has no scientific basis. Race categories are social constructs, that is, concepts created from prevailing social perceptions without scientific evidence. Despite modern proof that race is arbitrary biological fiction, racial taxons are still used widely in medical teaching, practice, and research. Human diversity is inconsistently taught in medical schools and erratically presented in medical texts. Race taxons have been "medicalized"; that is, race groupings have been legitimized by their use in medical literature and practice as acceptable descriptive labels that are integral to the proper diagnosis and treatment of disease in humans. Assumptions about disease that are made because a race has been assigned can result in important negative consequences for individual patients and inaccurate genetic inferences for populations. In contrast, ethnicity is a concept that incorporates social, religious, linguistic, dietary, and other variables to identify individual persons and populations. Ethnicity may be able to impart clinical clues to diagnosis if the clinician taking the history is well informed and open minded. Ethnic boundaries are dynamic and imprecise, and a strict methodical approach to ethnicity that is equal to the approach required for the study of other variables is necessary if the concept of ethnicity is to be clinically useful.},

To quantify the number of people in the US who delay medical care annually because of lack of available transportation and to examine the differential prevalence of this barrier for adults across sociodemographic characteristics and patient populations. Methods. We used data from the National Health Interview Survey (1997--2017) to examine this barrier over time and across groups. We used joinpoint regression analysis to identify significant changes in trends and multivariate analysis to examine correlates of this barrier for the year 2017. Results. In 2017, 5.8 million persons in the United States (1.8\%) delayed medical care because they did not have transportation. The proportion reporting transportation barriers increased between 2003 and 2009 with no significant trends before or after this window within our study period. We found that Hispanic people, those living below the poverty threshold, Medicaid recipients, and people with a functional limitation had greater odds of reporting a transportation barrier after we controlled for other sociodemographic and health characteristics.

  abstract = {Abstract                        Although pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have greatly reduced the incidence of invasive diseases caused by vaccine-targeted serotypes (VT) of             Streptococcus pneumoniae             , vaccine impact may be eroded by the increase in rates of disease caused by non-vaccine serotypes (NVT) -- a phenomenon known as serotype replacement. Here, we investigated the effect of social contact patterns on the dynamics of vaccine impact and serotype replacement in carriage.                      We developed a neutral, age-structured, susceptible--colonized (S--C) model incorporating VT-NVT co-colonization and childhood immunization with PCVs and verified it against real-world carriage data. Using empirically derived contact matrices from 34 countries, we assessed the impact of contact patterns of different age groups on the time-to-elimination, here defined as the time taken for the proportion of VT among circulating serotypes to drop to 5\% of the pre-PCV level. Finally, we quantified the contribution of various parameters---such as vaccine efficacy, coverage, immunity waning, and population susceptibility---to the dynamics of VT elimination.           Our model recapitulated the observed prevalence of carriage of VTs observed in the real-world data and showed that varying the contact structure alone led to different time-to-elimination (range: 3.8 -- 6 years). We found that higher total contact rate and assortativity in children under 5 were key factors in accelerating VT elimination. In addition, higher vaccine efficacy and coverage, and slower immunity waning led to shorter time-to-elimination.           These findings illuminate the mechanisms controlling the dynamics of vaccine impact and serotype replacement and may help predict the impact of the higher-valency PCVs in communities with different contact patterns.},

The current study aims to evaluate race/ethnicity-specific and etiology-specific factors contributing to lower post-LT survival among African Americans in the USA. The 2002-2012 United Network for Organ Sharing registry was utilized to evaluate race/ethnicity-specific post-LT survival among patients with HCV, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), alcoholic liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. From 2002 to 2012, HCV was the leading indication for LT. While African Americans accounted for 9.5\% of all LT during this period, they had the lowest overall and etiology-specific five-yr post-LT survival. On multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling, African Americans had significantly lower post-LT survival compared with non-Hispanic whites among patients with HCV (HR, 1.30; 95\% CI, 1.19-1.41), HCC (HR, 1.49; 95\% CI, 1.25-1.79), and ALD (HR, 1.52; 95\% CI, 1.19-1.94). In conclusion, African Americans had the lowest post-LT survival among patients with HCV, HCC, and ALD. Race/ethnicity and the etiology of chronic liver disease were observed to have a combined detrimental effect leading to lower survival following LT in African Americans.},

  abstract = {Segregation can be regarded as the spatial separation of different population groups. Most studies of segregation so far have relied on aspatial measures that are not effective to differentiate different spatial distribution patterns among population groups. Spatial measures have been introduced but have not been adopted widely because they are difficult to compute even with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). However, it is still logical to employ GIS technology to compute spatial segregation measures. A previous implementation attempt was successful, but inefficient and suffered from several short comings. This paper describes a recent effort to implement a set of spatial segregation measures in a GIS environment. An integrative approach is adopted to take advantage of various recent advances in GIS technology. Algorithms designed to implement spatial segregation measures consist of the general procedures to extract spatial information from feature data and to combine spatial information with attribute (population) data to derive the indices. Different types of spatial information include geometric characteristics and spatial relationship of the areal units, and the location information of the population. Using ArcView GIS and its Avenue programming tool as an application example, computations of various spatial segregation indices were implemented as additional functions in an ArcView user interface. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Using spatially aggregated data to evaluate segregation in the residential space has been the norm and thus individual's segregation experiences in other socio-geographical spaces are often de-emphasized or ignored. This paper attempts to provide a more comprehensive approach in evaluating segregation beyond the residential space. The entire activity spaces of individuals are taken into account with individuals serving as the building blocks of the analysis. The measurement principle is based upon the exposure dimension of segregation. The proposed measure reflects the exposure of individuals of a referenced group in a neighborhood to the populations of other groups that are found within the activity spaces of individuals in the referenced group. Using the travel diary data collected from the tri-county area in southeast Florida and the imputed racial-ethnic data, this paper demonstrates how the proposed segregation measurement approach goes beyond just measuring population distribution patterns in the residential space and can provide a more comprehensive evaluation of segregation by considering various socio-geographical spaces.},

We modeled death and population counts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to estimate excess death rates for the United States, 9 census divisions, and 50 states. We compared excess death rates for states with different partisan orientations, measured by the party of the seated governor and the level of partisan representation in state legislatures. Results. The United States experienced 1\,277\,697 excess deaths between March 2020 and July 2023. Almost 90\% of these deaths were attributed to COVID-19, and 51.5\% occurred after vaccines were available. The highest excess death rates first occurred in the Northeast and then shifted to the South and Mountain states. Between weeks ending June 20, 2020, through March 19, 2022, excess death rates were higher in states with Republican governors and greater Republican representation in state legislatures. Conclusions. Excess death rates during the COVID-19 pandemic varied considerably across the US states and were associated with partisan representation in state government, although the influence of confounding variables cannot be excluded.

Methods\enspace{} Publicly available data from The COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic were accessed between 9 September 2020 and 14 September 2020. For each state and the District of Columbia, \% infection, \% death, and \% population proportion for subgroups of race (African American/black (AA/black), Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN), and white) and ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino, non-\-Hispanic) were recorded. Crude and normalised disparity estimates were generated for COVID-19 infection (CDI and NDI) and mortality (CDM and NDM), computed as absolute and relative difference between \% infection or \% mortality and \% population proportion per state. Choropleth map display was created as thematic representation proportionate to CDI, NDI, CDM and NDM. Results\enspace{} The Hispanic population had a median of 158\% higher COVID-19 infection relative to their \% population proportion (median 158\%, IQR 100\%--200\%). This was followed by AA, with 50\% higher COVID-19 infection relative to their \% population proportion (median 50\%, IQR 25\%--100\%). The AA population had the most disproportionate mortality, with a median of 46\% higher mortality than the \% population proportion (median 46\%, IQR 18\%--66\%). Disproportionate impact of COVID-19 was also seen in AI/AN and Asian populations, with 100\% excess infections than the \% population proportion seen in nine states for AI/AN and seven states for Asian populations. There was no disproportionate impact in the white population in any state. Conclusions\enspace{} There are racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 infection/mortality, with distinct state-\- wise patterns across the USA based on racial/ethnic composition. There were missing and inconsistently reported racial/ethnic data in many states. This underscores the need for standardised reporting, attention to specific regional patterns, adequate resource allocation and addressing the underlying social determinants of health adversely affecting chronically marginalised groups.},

However, notable disparities exist between simulated phylogenetic trees used for training existing deep learning models and those derived from real-world sequence data, necessitating a thorough examination of their practicality. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of model performance by assessing an existing deep learning inference tool for phylodynamics, PhyloDeep, against realistic phylogenetic trees characterized from SARS-CoV-2. Our study reveals the poor predictive accuracy of PhyloDeep models trained on simulated trees when applied to realistic data. Conversely, models trained on realistic trees demonstrate improved predictions, despite not being infallible, especially in scenarios where superspreading dynamics are challenging to capture accurately. Consequently, we find markedly improved performance through the integration of minimal contact tracing data. Applying this approach to a sample of SARS-CoV-2 sequences partially matched to contact tracing from Hong Kong yields informative estimates of SARS-CoV-2 superspreading potential beyond the scope of contact tracing data alone. Our findings demonstrate the potential for enhancing deep learning phylodynamic models processing low resolution trees through complementary data integration, ultimately increasing the precision of epidemiological predictions crucial for public health decision making and outbreak control.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: While the incidence and mortality of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) continue to increase across the United States (US), disparities may exist relative to treatment modality and survival. The objective of the present study was to determine the factors associated with racial differences in survival among patients with HCC in the US. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was used to identify patients with HCC between 1998 and 2012 in the US. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to examine associations between type of therapy and race, while a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was built to determine the effect of race on survival. RESULTS: A total of 58,186 patients with HCC were identified. Over two-thirds of patients were white (n=39,223, 67.4\%), while 18.3\% were Asian (n=10,665), 13.1\% black (n=7,620) and 1.2\% native American (n=678). In comparison to other racial groups, Asian patients with HCC tended to be older [white vs. black vs. native American vs. Asian: median age: 63 years, interquartile range (IQR), 55-73 vs. 59 years, IQR, 53-66 vs. 59 years, IQR, 53-69 vs. 64 years, IQR, 55-73, P{$<$}0.001] and were diagnosed with larger tumors (white vs. black vs. native American vs. Asian: median tumor size: 4.8 cm, IQR, 3.0-8.0 vs. 5.1 cm, IQR, 3.1-8.7 vs. 4.8 cm, IQR, 3.0-7.3 vs. 5.5 cm, IQR, 3.1-9.0, P{$<$}0.001). Asian patients were also less likely to present with concomitant cirrhosis (white vs. black vs. native American vs. Asian: 81.8\% vs. 77.7\% vs. 83.2\% vs. 69.1\%, P{$<$}0.001) while elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein more were often noted among black patients (white vs. black vs. native American vs. Asian: 25.5\% vs. 14.9\% vs. 22.2\% vs. 21.8\%, P{$<$}0.001). Compared to other racial groups, Asian patients were most likely to receive any form of treatment (white vs. black vs. native American vs. Asian: 29.2\% vs. 25.2\% vs. 27.6\% vs. 34.4\%, P{$<$}0.001). In particular, after controlling for potential confounders, Asian patients demonstrated the greatest odds of undergoing surgery (OR: 1.48, 95\% CI, 1.13-1.95, P=0.01). The median overall survival (OS) was 11 months with the worst prognosis noted among black patients. After accounting for disease and patient factors, Asian patients demonstrated the lowest risk for death [hazard ratio (HR): 0.76, 95\% CI, 0.66-0.87, P{$<$}0.001] while no differences were noted in the risk of death among other racial groups (all P{$>$}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Significant racial differences were noted in presentation, treatment and survival among patients with HCC. Further research is necessary to better understand socio-demographic and biological factors driving racial disparities in care. Future policies should aim to improve access to care among racial/ethnic minorities.},

  abstract = {The county-level geographic mortality differentials have persisted in the past four decades in the United States (US). Though several socioeconomic factors (e.g., inequality) partially explain this phenomenon, the role of race/ethnic segregation, in general, and the different dimensions of segregation, more specifically, has been underexplored. Focusing on all-cause age-sex standardized US county-level mortality (2004-2008), this study has two substantive goals: (1) to understand whether segregation is a determinant of mortality and if yes, how the relationship between segregation and mortality varies by racial/ethnic dyads (e.g., white/black), and (2) to explore whether different dimensions of segregation (i.e., evenness, exposure, concentration, centralization, and clustering) are associated with mortality. A third goal is methodological: to assess whether spatial autocorrelation influences our understanding of the associations between the dimensions of segregation and mortality. Race/ethnic segregation was found to contribute to the geographic mortality disparities. Moreover, the relationship with mortality differed by both race/ethnic group and the dimension of segregation. Specifically, white/black segregation is positively related to mortality, whereas the segregation between whites and non-black minorities is negatively associated with mortality. Among the five dimensions of segregation, evenness and exposure are more strongly related to mortality than other dimensions. Spatial filtering approaches also identified six unique spatial patterns that significantly affect the spatial distribution of mortality. These patterns offer possible insights that help identify omitted variables related to the persistent patterning of mortality in the US.}

  abstract = {\copyright{} 2018 American Cancer Society BACKGROUND: The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been rising rapidly in the United States. California is an ethnically diverse state with the largest number of incident HCC cases in the country. Characterizing HCC disparities in California may inform priorities for HCC prevention. METHODS: By using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18-Registry Database and the California Cancer Registry, age-adjusted HCC incidence in California from 2009 through 2013 was calculated by race/ethnicity and neighborhood ethnic enclave status. A geographic analysis was conducted using Medical Service Study Areas (MSSAs) as the geographic unit, and race/ethnicity-specific standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated to identify MSSAs with higher-than-expected HCC incidence compared with the statewide average. RESULTS: During 2009 through 2013, the age-adjusted incidence of HCC in California was the highest in Asians/Pacific Islanders (APIs) and Hispanics ({$>$}100\% higher than whites), especially those living in more ethnic neighborhoods (20\%-30\% higher than less ethnic neighborhoods). Of the 542 MSSAs statewide, 42 had elevated HCC incidence (SIR {$\geq$} 1.5; lower bound of 95\% confidence interval {$>$} 1) for whites, 14 for blacks, 24 for APIs, and 36 for Hispanics. These MSSAs have 24\% to 52\% higher proportions of individuals below the 100\% federal poverty line than other MSSAs. CONCLUSIONS: APIs and Hispanics residing in more ethnic neighborhoods and individuals residing in lower income neighborhoods require more extensive preventive efforts tailored toward their unique risk factor profiles. The current race/ethnicity-specific geographic analysis can be extended to other states to inform priorities for HCC targeted prevention at the subcounty level, eventually reducing HCC burden in the country.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims: Hepatitis B (HBV) infection remains a major public health problem in South Korea, and accounts for considerable morbidity and mortality. At present, very little is known about the cost of HBV to the South Korean health-care system and society. The present study was therefore conducted to estimate the total annual cost of HBV infection in South Korea for a given year (1997). Methods: The study was conducted from the South Korean societal perspective, taking into account the direct and indirect costs of HBV vaccination programs (prevention costs), and those related to the treatment of acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and liver cancer (disease costs). Several assumptions were made in arriving to actual cost estimates. Results: The total societal cost of HBV in 1997 was 1078.3 billion Won (\$US 959.7 million), 142.3 billion Won or 13.2\% being attributable to prevention costs and 225.4 billion Won or 20.9\% being attributable to indirect costs of HBV-related diseases. The total cost (direct plus indirect) associated with HBV-related diseases to the South Korean society was 936.1 billion Won (\$US 833.1 million), of which 45.3\% was attributable to cirrhosis-related costs. In terms of disease-related direct costs alone (710.5 billion Won or \$US 632.3 million), the estimated annual spending per patient was 1.37 million Won (\$US 1219). The direct costs of the HBV disease (prevention and disease treatment, amounting to 782.2 billion Won or \$US 696.2 million) is equivalent to 3.2\% of the national health-care expenditure for 1997. Conclusions: This study confirms that HBV is a significant cost burden to the South Korean society, and in the absence of an effective cure reinforces the importance of continued disease prevention via vaccination.},

Fortunately, the availability of new therapies has improved the treatment landscape, offering safer and more effective options. However, there remains a need to establish and implement optimal clinical and therapeutic approaches for managing these infections.

The results showed that the prevalences of HBV and HCV in 110 patients were 85.45\% and 17.27\% respectively, and were significantly higher that in control (50.45\% and 4.09\%). Using Conditional Logistic Regression Model. we found that the main risk factors of HCC in Qidong were HBsAg and Pre-S2 for HBV and anti-HCV for HCV. The OR value were 10.22, 2.96 and 2.63, respectively. Drinking tea was the only protective factor (OR = 0.36). Among 110 HCC patients. 13.64\% were positive for both HBV and HCV. The OR value was the highest (6.48). 88.18\% patients were either HBV or HCV positive. The OR values were similar (3.90 and 3.89). It suggests that the most important risk factor of HCC in Qidong was HBV infection because it had a higher prevalence among the population while the HCV infection having an equal OR value was also a risk factor.},

  abstract = {Chronic liver diseases are one of the major public health issues in United States, and there are substantial racial disparities in liver cancer-related mortality. We previously identified racially distinct alterations in the expression of transcripts and proteins of hepatitis C (HCV)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between Caucasian (CA) and African American (AA) subgroups. Here, we performed a comparative genome-wide analysis of normal vs. HCV+ (cirrhotic state), and normal adjacent tissues (HCCN) vs. HCV+HCC (tumor state) of CA at the gene and alternative splicing levels using Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array (HTA2.0). Many genes and splice variants were abnormally expressed in HCV+ more than in HCV+HCC state compared with normal tissues. Known biological pathways related to cell cycle regulations were altered in HCV+HCC, whereas acute phase reactants were deregulated in HCV+ state. We confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR that SAA1, PCNA-AS1, DAB2, and IFI30 are differentially deregulated, especially in AA compared with CA samples. Likewise, IHC staining analysis revealed altered expression patterns of SAA1 and HNF4{$\alpha$} isoforms in HCV+ liver samples of AA compared with CA. These results demonstrate that several splice variants are primarily deregulated in normal vs. HCV+ stage, which is certainly in line with the recent observations showing that the pre-mRNA splicing machinery may be profoundly remodeled during disease progression, and may, therefore, play a major role in HCV racial disparity. The confirmation that certain genes are deregulated in AA compared to CA tissues also suggests that there is a biological basis for the observed racial disparities.},

This study was conducted to characterize the effectiveness of DAAs in a socioeconomically disadvantaged and underinsured patient cohort. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included all patients undergoing HCV treatment with DAA-based therapy between April 2014 and June 2016 at a large urban safety-net health system (Parkland Health and Hospital System, Dallas, TX, USA). The primary outcome was sustained virologic response (SVR), with secondary outcomes including treatment discontinuation, treatment relapse, and loss to follow-up. RESULTS: DAA-based therapy was initiated in 512 patients. The cohort was socioeconomically disadvantaged (56\% uninsured and 13\% Medicaid), with high historic rates of alcohol (41\%) and substance (50\%) use, and mental health disorders (38\%). SVR was achieved in 90\% of patients (n=459); 26 patients (5\%) were lost to follow-up. SVR was significantly lower in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (82\% SVR; OR 0.37, 95\% CI 0.16-0.85) but did not differ by insurance status (P=0.98) or alcohol/substance use (P=0.34). Reasons for treatment failure included loss to follow-up (n=26, 5\%), viral relapse (n=16, 3\%), non-treatment-related death (n=7, 1\%), and treatment discontinuation (n=4, 1\%). Of patients with viral relapse, 6 reported non-compliance and have not been retreated, 5 have been retreated and achieved SVR, 4 have undergone resistance testing but not yet initiated retreatment, and 1 was lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Effective outcomes with DAA-based therapy can be achieved in difficult-to-treat underinsured populations followed in resource-constrained safety-net health systems.},

We performed ALDH2 genotyping on lymphocyte DNA samples from Japanese alcoholic men (487 cancer-free; 237 with cancer, including 34 oropharyngolaryngeal, 87 esophageal, 58 stomach, 46 colon, 18 liver, 7 lung, 9 other sites, and 19 multiple primary cancers in two or three organs).

We investigated the role of betaAR stimulation in augmenting cardiac function and its role in the activation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) using various betaAR knockouts (KO) including beta(1)ARKO, beta(2)ARKO, and beta(1)/beta(2)AR double-KO (DKO) mice. We employed a murine model of left anterior descending coronary artery ligation to examine the differential contributions of specific betaAR subtypes in the activation of CaMKII in vivo in failing myocardium. Cardiac inotropy, chronotropy, and CaMKII activity following short-term isoproterenol stimulation were significantly attenuated in beta(1)ARKO and DKO compared with either the beta(2)ARKO or wild-type (WT) mice, indicating that beta(1)ARs are required for catecholamine-induced increases in contractility and CaMKII activity. Eight weeks after myocardial infarction (MI), beta(1)ARKO and DKO mice showed a significant attenuation in fractional shortening compared with either the beta(2)ARKO or WT mice. CaMKII activity after MI was significantly increased only in the beta(2)ARKO and WT hearts and not in the beta(1)ARKO and DKO hearts. The border zone of the infarct in the beta(2)ARKO and WT hearts demonstrated significantly increased apoptosis by TUNEL staining compared with the beta(1)ARKO and DKO hearts. Taken together, these data show that cardiac function and CaMKII activity are mediated almost exclusively by the beta(1)AR. Moreover, it appears that beta(1)AR signaling is detrimental to cardiac function following MI, possibly through activation of CaMKII.},

However, efficiency of multivariable analysis highly depends on correlation structure among predictive variables. When the covariates in the model are not independent one another, collinearity/multicollinearity problems arise in the analysis, which leads to biased estimation. This work aims to perform a simulation study with various scenarios of different collinearity structures to investigate the effects of collinearity under various correlation structures amongst predictive and explanatory variables and to compare these results with existing guidelines to decide harmful collinearity.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Little is known about whether dietary cholesterol affects disease progression in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment Against Cirrhosis trial, which included patients with advanced fibrosis and compensated cirrhosis. Cholesterol intake was determined for 608 participants on the basis of responses to food frequency questionnaires, administered at baseline and 1.8 years later. We investigated whether cholesterol intake was associated with clinical progression (death, variceal bleeding, encephalopathy, ascites, peritonitis, Child-Turcotte-Pugh score {$>$}/= 7, or hepatocellular carcinoma) or histologic progression of disease (an increase in Ishak fibrosis score of 2 or more points in a second liver biopsy compared with the first). RESULTS: After adjustments for age, sex, race, presence of cirrhosis, body mass index, treatment with peginterferon, lifetime alcohol consumption, smoking, health status, and coffee and macronutrient intake, each higher quartile of cholesterol intake was associated with a 46\% increase in the risk of clinical or histologic progression (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.46; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.87; P for the trend = .004). Compared with patients in the lowest quartile of cholesterol intake (32-152 mg/day), those in the 3rd (224-310 mg/day; AHR, 2.83; 95\% CI, 1.45-5.51) and 4th quartiles ({$>$}310 mg/day; AHR, 2.74; 95\% CI, 1.22-6.16) had significantly increased risk of disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of analysis of data from the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment Against Cirrhosis trial, higher dietary cholesterol intake is associated with higher risk of disease progression in HCV-infected patients with advanced fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis.},

  abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the major cancers in China. Accordingly, the mortality rates in 1990 (per 100,000) were 20.10 in certain cities and 24.32 in certain counties. More than 90\% of HCC cases and 70\% of controls were infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Odds Ratio (OR) = 10-50). In the same group of patients, 8-27\% of those with HCC and 0-11\% of the healthy controls were also infected with hepatitis C (HCV) (OR = 2.11-17.29). There appears to be some correlation between HBV markers and the OR. The government requires that 85\% of infants be immunized with HBV vaccine. In 1992, there were 3 million infants inoculated with HB vaccines. Aflatoxins have been found as contaminants in food, particularly in corn, peanut oil, soya sauce and fermented soya beans. The intake of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) by people of ten different villages correlated with HCC mortality rates (r = 0.55; P {$<$} 0.05). The concentration of AFB1-albumin adducts is an indicator of individual exposure to aflatoxins. These adducts are higher in hyperendemic HCC areas and cases. Most people have now changed their staple food and eat rice instead of corn. Six large epidemiological studies have confirmed that people who drink pond-ditch water experience higher HCC mortality rates than people who drink deep-well water. Recent research has found that the blue-green algal toxin microcystin (MCYST) was a contaminant of pond-ditch water. MCYST is a strong promoter of HCC and will induce severe intrahepatic haemorrhages and liver necrosis. More than 80\% of people in Qidong County have already changed their sources of water from pond-ditches to deep wells. Therefore, a combined strategy of the prevention of hepatitis, control of crops and control of drinking water is advocated for the primary prevention of HCC in China.},

  abstract = {As the U.S. healthcare system transforms its care delivery model to increase healthcare accessibility and improve health outcomes, it is undergoing changes in the context of ever-increasing chronic disease burdens and healthcare costs. Many illnesses disproportionately affect certain populations, due to disparities in healthcare access and social determinants of health. These disparities represent a key area to target in order to better our nation's overall health and decrease healthcare expenditures. It is thus imperative for policymakers and health professionals to develop innovative interventions that sustainably manage chronic diseases, promote preventative health, and improve outcomes among communities disenfranchised from traditional healthcare as well as among the general population. This article examines the available literature on Mobile Health Clinics (MHCs) and the role that they currently play in the U.S. healthcare system. Based on a search in the PubMed database and data from the online collaborative research network of mobile clinics MobileHealthMap.org, the authors evaluated 51 articles with evidence on the strengths and weaknesses of the mobile health sector in the United States. Current literature supports that MHCs are successful in reaching vulnerable populations, by delivering services directly at the curbside in communities of need and flexibly adapting their services based on the changing needs of the target community. As a link between clinical and community settings, MHCs address both medical and social determinants of health, tackling health issues on a community-wide level. Furthermore, evidence suggest that MHCs produce significant cost savings and represent a cost-effective care delivery model that improves health outcomes in underserved groups. Even though MHCs can fulfill many goals and mandates in alignment with our national priorities and have the potential to help combat some of the largest healthcare challenges of this era, there are limitations and challenges to this healthcare delivery model that must be addressed and overcome before they can be more broadly integrated into our healthcare system.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study involved 186 patients (146 men and 40 women; median age, 65 y [interquartile range, 57-72.3 y]). Of 186 patients, 146 (78.5\%) were hepatitis B virus carriers, 18 (9.7\%) were hepatitis C virus carriers, 82 (44.1\%) had tumors {$>$}/= 5 cm, and 43 (23.1\%) had multifocal tumors. Overall survival (OS), complete response (CR) by European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria, time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), and treatment toxicities were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses for prognostic factors of OS were performed. RESULTS: Median OS was 25.7 months (95\% confidence interval [CI], 20.9-30.5) and varied significantly between Child-Pugh A and B (28.7 mo vs 13.4 mo, P {$<$} .001), and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer A and B or C (37.1 mo vs 17.7 mo, P = .001). Prognostic factors for longer OS were solitary tumor, tumor size {$<$} 5 cm, {$>$} 1 treatments, and CR of all tumors at 6 months. TTP was 9.1 months (95\% CI, 6.9-11.3). PFS was 8.4 months (95\% CI, 7.1-9.7). CR occurred in 69.1\% (159/230) of lesions and 48.9\% (88/180) of patients at 6 months. Any one symptom of the postembolization syndrome of grade 2 severity occurred in {$<$} 22\% (41/186) of patients. No treatment-related hepatitis or death occurred within 30 days. Transient respiratory decompensation occurred in three patients (1.6\% [3/186]), and alcoholic intoxication occurred in one patient (0.5\% [1/186]). CONCLUSIONS: TEA appears to be safe and effective for local control of HCC.},

Therefore, biomarkers are needed to help physicians form a correct diagnosis and initiate the right treatment to improve patient outcomes following first presentation or admittance to hospital. Here, we review the landscape of novel biomarkers and approaches of biomarker discovery. We first discuss the use of current plasma parameters and whole blood biomarkers, including results obtained by RNA profiling and mass spectrometry, to discriminate between bacterial and viral infections. Next we expand upon the use of biomarkers to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious disease. Finally, we discuss the strengths as well as the potential pitfalls of current developments. We conclude that the use of combination tests, using either protein markers or transcriptomic analysis, have advanced considerably and should be further explored to improve current diagnostics regarding febrile infections and inflammation. If proven effective when combined, these biomarker signatures will greatly accelerate early and tailored treatment decisions.},

  abstract = {Researchers have found that, compared to European Americans, African Americans report later initiation of drinking, lower rates of use, and lower levels of use across almost all age groups. Nevertheless, African Americans also have higher levels of alcohol problems than European Americans. After reviewing current data regarding these trends, we provide a theory to understand this apparent paradox as well as to understand variability in risk among African Americans. Certain factors appear to operate as both protective factors against heavy use and risk factors for negative consequences from use. For example, African American culture is characterized by norms against heavy alcohol use or intoxication, which protects against heavy use but also provides within-group social disapproval when use does occur. African Americans are more likely to encounter legal problems from drinking than European Americans, even at the same levels of consumption, perhaps thus resulting in reduced consumption but more problems from consumption. There appears to be one particular group of African Americans, low-income African American men, who are at the highest risk for alcoholism and related problems. We theorize that this effect is due to the complex interaction of residential discrimination, racism, age of drinking, and lack of available standard life reinforcers (e.g., stable employment and financial stability). Further empirical research will be needed to test our theories and otherwise move this important field forward. A focus on within-group variation in drinking patterns and problems is necessary. We suggest several new avenues of inquiry.},

Long distances and travel times to facilities offering low- or no-fee mammography may be important barriers to adherence to mammography screening recommendations for women living in economically disadvantaged urban neighborhoods, in which African-Americans are disproportionately represented. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the spatial distribution of facilities providing low- or no-fee screening mammography in Chicago, Illinois, is equitable on the basis of neighborhood socioeconomic and racial characteristics. We found that distance and travel times via automobile and public transportation to facilities generally decrease as neighborhood poverty increases. However, we also found that the strength of the association between neighborhood poverty level and two of the spatial accessibility measures-distance and public transportation travel time-is less strong in African-American neighborhoods. Among neighborhoods with the greatest need for facilities (i.e., neighborhoods with the highest proportions of residents in poverty), African-American neighborhoods have longer travel distances and public transportation travel times than neighborhoods with proportionately fewer African-American residents. Thus, it appears that the spatial accessibility of low- and no-fee mammography services is inequitable in Chicago. In view of persistent social disparities in health such as breast cancer outcomes, these findings suggest it is important for researchers to examine the spatial distribution of health resources by both the socioeconomic and racial characteristics of urban neighborhoods.},

  abstract = {Backgrounds: Up to February 16, 2020, 355 cases have been confirmed as having COVID-19 infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. It is of crucial importance to estimate the reproductive number (R0) of the novel virus in the early stage of outbreak and make a prediction of daily new cases on the ship. Method: We fitted the reported serial interval (mean and standard deviation) with a gamma distribution and applied ``earlyR'' package in R to estimate the R0 in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak. We applied ``projections'' package in R to simulate the plausible cumulative epidemic trajectories and future daily incidence by fitting the data of existing daily incidence, a serial interval distribution, and the estimated R0 into a model based on the assumption that daily incidence obeys approximately Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. Results: The Maximum-Likelihood (ML) value of R0 was 2.28 for COVID-19 outbreak at the early stage on the ship. The median with 95\% confidence interval (CI) of R0 values was 2.28 (2.06--2.52) estimated by the bootstrap resampling method. The probable number of new cases for the next ten days would gradually increase, and the estimated cumulative cases would reach 1514 (1384--1656) at the tenth day in the future. However, if R0 value was reduced by 25\% and 50\%, the estimated total number of cumulative cases would be reduced to 1081 (981--1177) and 758 (697--817), respectively. Conclusion: The median with 95\% CI of R0 of COVID-19 was about 2.28 (2.06--2.52) during the early stage experienced on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The future daily incidence and probable outbreak size is largely dependent on the change of R0. Unless strict infection management and control are taken, our findings indicate the potential of COVID-19 to cause greater outbreak on the ship.},

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to review the evidence currently available to examine the potential role of metformin in chemoprevention for liver cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes. DATA SOURCES: The data sources of the study included the PubMed and SciVerse Scopus databases. STUDY SELECTION: Selection included studies that assessed the effect of metformin therapy on the risk of liver cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes. DATA EXTRACTION: Summary effect estimates were derived using a random-effects meta-analysis model. DATA SYNTHESIS: A database was developed on the basis of five studies consisting of approximately 105,495 patients with type 2 diabetes. In meta-analyses, metformin was associated with an estimated 62\% reduction in the risk of liver cancer among patients with type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 0.38, 95\% confidence interval 0.24, 0.59; P {$<$} 0.001). The effect estimates were heterogeneous across the five included studies (P for heterogeneity = 0.001; I(2) = 78\%). When restricting the analysis to the four studies related to hepatocellular carcinoma, metformin was again associated with a significantly lower cancer risk (odds ratio 0.30, 95\% confidence interval 0.17, 0.52; P {$<$} 0.001), and there was evidence of significant heterogeneity between these four studies (P for heterogeneity = 0.03; I(2) = 67\%). CONCLUSIONS: Metformin appears to be associated with a lower risk of liver cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Traditional survey methods for obtaining nationwide small-area estimates (SAEs) of childhood obesity are costly. This study applied a geocoded national health survey in a multilevel modeling framework to estimate prevalence of childhood obesity at the census block-group level. METHODS: We constructed a multilevel logistic regression model to evaluate the influence of individual demographic characteristics, zip code, county, and state on the childhood obesity measures from the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health. The obesity risk for a child in each census block group was then estimated on the basis of this multilevel model. We compared direct survey and model-based SAEs to evaluate the model specification. RESULTS: Multilevel models in this study explained about 60\% of state-level variances associated with childhood obesity, 82.8\% to 86.5\% of county-level, and 93.1\% of zip code-level. The 95\% confidence intervals of block- group level SAEs have a wide range (0.795-20.0), a low median of 2.02, and a mean of 2.12. The model-based SAEs of childhood obesity prevalence ranged from 2.3\% to 54.7\% with a median of 16.0\% at the block-group level. CONCLUSION: The geographic variances among census block groups, counties, and states demonstrate that locale may be as significant as individual characteristics such as race/ethnicity in the development of the childhood obesity epidemic. Our estimates provide data to identify priority areas for local health programs and to establish feasible local intervention goals. Model-based SAEs of population health outcomes could be a tool of public health assessment and surveillance.},

  abstract = {Purpose To compare changes on ultrasonographic (US), computed tomographic (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) images after irreversible electroporation (IRE) ablation of liver and tumor tissues in a rodent hepatoma model. Materials and Methods Studies received approval from the institutional animal care and use committee. Forty-eight rats were used, and N1-S1 tumors were implanted in 24. Rats were divided into groups and allocated for studies with each modality. Imaging was performed in normal liver tissues and tumors before and after IRE. MR imaging was performed in one group before and after IRE after hepatic vessel ligation. US images were graded to determine echogenicity changes, CT attenuation was measured (in Hounsfield units), and MR imaging signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was measured before and after IRE. Student t test was used to compare attenuation and SNR measurements before and after IRE (P {$<$} .05 indicated a significant difference). Results IRE ablation produced greater alterations to echogenicity in normal tissues than in tumors. Attenuation in ablated liver tissues was reduced compared with that in control tissues (P {$<$} .001), while small attenuation differences between ablated (42.11 HU \textpm{} 2.11) and control (45.14 HU \textpm{} 2.64) tumors trended toward significance (P = .052). SNR in ablated normal tissues was significantly altered after IRE (T1-weighted images: pre-IRE, 145.95 \textpm{} 24.32; post-IRE, 97.80 \textpm{} 18.03; P = .004; T2-weighted images, pre-IRE, 47.37 \textpm{} 18.31; post-IRE, 90.88 \textpm{} 37.15; P = .023). In tumors, SNR differences before and after IRE were not significant. No post-IRE signal changes were observed after hepatic vessel ligation. Conclusion IRE induces rapid changes on gray-scale US, unenhanced CT, and MR images. These changes are readily visible and may assist a performing physician to delineate ablation zones from the unablated surrounding parenchyma. \copyright{} RSNA, 2014 Online supplemental material is available for this article.},

  abstract = {Although laboratory studies linked zinc and heme iron to colorectal cancer, epidemiologic evidence is limited. We prospectively examined these associations in the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. We used Cox proportional hazards regression analyses to calculate cohort-specific relative risks (RRs) and pooled results using a fixed-effects model. We documented 2,114 incident colorectal cancer cases during up to 22~years of follow-up. Compared highest to lowest quintile of dietary zinc intake, the pooled multivariable RRs (95\% CIs) were 0.86 (0.73, 1.02) for colorectal cancer, 0.92 (0.76, 1.11) for colon cancer, and 0.68 (0.47, 0.99) for rectal cancer. The significant inverse association between dietary zinc intake and risk of rectal cancer was mainly driven by data in women, although the difference in the sex-specific results was not statistically significant. For the same comparison, the pooled multivariable RRs (95\% CIs) for heme iron were 1.10 (0.93, 1.30) for colorectal cancer, 1.06 (0.88, 1.29) for colon cancer, and 1.20 (0.83, 1.75) for rectal cancer. These associations were not significantly modified by alcohol consumption, body mass index, physical activity, menopausal status, or postmenopausal hormone use. Total zinc intake, total iron intake, dietary iron intake, and zinc or iron supplement uses were largely not associated with colorectal cancer risk. Our study does not support strong roles of zinc and heme iron intake in colorectal cancer risk; however, a suggestive inverse association of dietary zinc intake with rectal cancer risk in women requires further study.},

Appreciable portions of the Hispanic-White gap (33\%) and the Black-White gap (53\%) were accounted for by family background factors, individual differences, and neighborhood factors.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the first eukaryotic organism for which a multi-compartment genome-scale metabolic model was constructed. Since then a sequence of improved metabolic reconstructions for yeast has been introduced. These metabolic models have been extensively used to elucidate the organizational principles of yeast metabolism and drive yeast strain engineering strategies for targeted overproductions. They have also served as a starting point and a benchmark for the reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic models for other eukaryotic organisms. In spite of the successive improvements in the details of the described metabolic processes, even the recent yeast model (i.e., iMM904) remains significantly less predictive than the latest E. coli model (i.e., iAF1260). This is manifested by its significantly lower specificity in predicting the outcome of grow/no grow experiments in comparison to the E. coli model. RESULTS: In this paper we make use of the automated GrowMatch procedure for restoring consistency with single gene deletion experiments in yeast and extend the procedure to make use of synthetic lethality data using the genome-scale model iMM904 as a basis. We identified and vetted using literature sources 120 distinct model modifications including various regulatory constraints for minimal and YP media. The incorporation of the suggested modifications led to a substantial increase in the fraction of correctly predicted lethal knockouts (i.e., specificity) from 38.84\% (87 out of 224) to 53.57\% (120 out of 224) for the minimal medium and from 24.73\% (45 out of 182) to 40.11\% (73 out of 182) for the YP medium. Synthetic lethality predictions improved from 12.03\% (16 out of 133) to 23.31\% (31 out of 133) for the minimal medium and from 6.96\% (8 out of 115) to 13.04\% (15 out of 115) for the YP medium. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study provides a roadmap for the computationally driven correction of multi-compartment genome-scale metabolic models and demonstrates the value of synthetic lethals as curation agents.},

  abstract = {Patients must have transportation before they can access appropriate cancer care. The Cancer Care Assessment \& Responsive Evaluation Studies (C-CARES) questionnaire surveyed colorectal cancer patients diagnosed in 2008 throughout the VA healthcare system. A minority (19\%) of respondents reported transportation barriers. Patients experiencing pain and who reported no primary social support (OR 6.13, 95\% CI 3.10, 12.14) or non-spousal support (OR 2.00, 95\% CI 1.40, 2.87) were more likely to experience transportation barriers. Background: Patients must have transportation to the treatment site before they can access appropriate cancer care. This article describes factors associated with patients experiencing transportation-related barriers to accessing cancer care. Patients and Methods: The Cancer Care Assessment \& Responsive Evaluation Studies (C-CARES) questionnaire was mailed to Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) during the fall of 2009. Eligible patients were diagnosed at any VA facility in 2008, they were men, and alive at the time of the mailing. A total of 1409 surveys were returned (approximately 67\% response rate). To assess transportation barriers, patients were asked how often it was difficult to get transportation to or from treatment. Symptoms were assessed using validated Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scales for fatigue, pain, and depression. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine determinants of transportation barriers. Results: A minority of respondents (19\%) reported transportation barriers. Patients experiencing pain (OR, 1.04; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.06) had greater odds of transportation barriers than patients without this symptom. Patients who reported no primary social support (OR, 6.13; 95\% CI, 3.10-12.14) or nonspousal support (OR, 2.00; 95\% CI, 1.40-2.87) were more likely to experience transportation barriers than patients whose spouses provided social support. Discussion: Patients with uncontrolled pain or less social support have greater odds of transportation barriers. The directional association between social support, symptoms, and transportation cannot be determined in this data. Conclusion: Inquiring about accessible transportation should become a routine part of cancer care, particularly for patients with known risk factors.},
